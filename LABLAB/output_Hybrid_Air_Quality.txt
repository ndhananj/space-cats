A Hybrid Air Quality Prediction Model Based on
Empirical Mode Decomposition
Yuxuan Cao, Difei Zhang, Shaoqi Ding, Weiyi Zhong, and Chao Yan
Abstract: Air pollution is a severe environmental problem in urban areas. Accurate air quality prediction can help
governments and individuals make proper decisions to cope with potential air pollution. As a classic time series
forecasting model, the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) has been widely adopted in air quality
prediction. However, because of the volatility of air quality and the lack of additional context information, i.e., the
spatial relationships among monitor stations, traditional ARIMA models suffer from unstable prediction performance.
Though some deep networks can achieve higher accuracy, a mass of training data, heavy computing, and time cost
are required. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model to simultaneously predict seven air pollution indicators from
multiple monitoring stations. The proposed model consists of three components: (1) an extended ARIMA to predict
matrix series of multiple air quality indicators from several adjacent monitoring stations; (2) the Empirical Mode
Decomposition (EMD) to decompose the air quality time series data into multiple smooth sub-series; and (3) the
truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress and denoise the expanded matrix. Experimental results
on the public dataset show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-art air quality forecasting models in
both accuracy and time cost.

is becoming severe in urban areas with the expansion
of urbanization. An estimated seven million people
are killed by exposure to outdoor environments with
air pollution every year[2]. Therefore, air pollution
has become a major environmental health problem in
the world, especially in the low- and middle-income
countries.
In order to provide accurate measurements of air
quality and protect residents from the dangers of ambient
air pollution, many air quality monitoring stations have
been established in different areas of major cities. Those
monitoring stations collect and release real-time air
quality data, which includes concentrations of SO2,
NO2, CO, O3, PM2:5, PM10, and Air Quality Index
(AQI) calculated by the aforementioned concentrations.
Besides monitoring the current air quality, it is essential
to predict future data in next hours or days. Accurate

and reliable air quality prediction can provide valuable
information for residents‚Äô daily travel, the government‚Äôs
environmental management, and air pollution prevention
and control[3].
Air quality prediction is usually viewed as a time
series forecasting problem. With the rise of artiÔ¨Åcial
intelligence[4, 5], existing time series forecasting models,
including regression models[6],
machine learning
models[7], and deep learning models[8‚Äì10], have been
applied in air quality prediction.
However, there are still many challenges for air quality
prediction.
First, because air quality is inÔ¨Çuenced
by many factors, such as weather conditions, spatial
features, even electronic devices[11], and so on, it is
impossible to model all the factors. Second, air quality
varies signiÔ¨Åcantly at different times and locations.
It is difÔ¨Åcult to achieve high accuracy if we do not
take the spatial and temporal features into account.
Third, because of the vulnerability of the network and
monitoring devices, the collected air quality data may be
incomplete[12]. In another word, there is a lot of noise
existing in the collected data, which may inÔ¨Çuence the
accuracy of prediction models.
In view of the aforementioned challenges, we
propose a hybrid model which integrates the extended
AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
model with the Empirical Mode Decomposition
(EMD)[13] and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)[14]
to predict air quality data in the next hours. In this study,
we Ô¨Årst extend the classic ARIMA model to cope with
matrix time series forecasting. Then, we use EMD to
decompose the non-stationary air quality series data into
multiple smooth sub-series and merge them into a new
matrix series. Finally, we compress and denoise the
matrix using truncate SVD, and feed the matrix series
into an extended ARIMA model. Concretely, the main
contributions of this study are as follows:
(1) We extend the classical ARIMA model to support
matrix time series forecasting, which can predict all
seven air quality indicators from multiple monitoring
stations simultaneously.
(2) To better handle the Ô¨Çuctuating data,
we
decompose original non-stationary air quality data into
smooth sub-series by the empirical mode decomposition
method.
(3) We use truncated SVD to compress air quality
series to remove the noisy data and capture correlations
among air pollutants and neighbor stations.
(4) We conducted experiments on a real-world air
quality dataset. Experimental results show that our
proposed model can improve the accuracy and reduce
the computational cost compared with the state-of-art air
quality prediction models.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
We present recent related research on air quality
prediction in Section 2. Section 3 introduces our method
in detail and presents the formulation process. The
experimental evaluation is given in Section 4, and
Section 5 concludes our work.

Related Work
Air quality prediction is a hot research topic in recent
years, and many prediction methods have been proposed.
With the development of artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence and big
data technology[15], machine learning and deep models
have also attracted attention in various Ô¨Åelds[16‚Äì18]. For
example, the random forest model[19], support vector
regression[20], and long short-term memory[21] are used
in air quality prediction. Traditional models are still
widely used due to their simplicity and efÔ¨Åciency.
2.1
Air quality prediction based on traditional
models
There have been a number of statistical methods
widely used in air quality prediction, e.g., the classical
ARIMA model and linear regression. Zhang et al.[22]
proposed a new hybrid prediction model using a
nonlinear autoregressive (namely NARX) network
and ARMA to solve the deterministic part and
error part of meteorological data, respectively. The
results of experiments conducted on the data of
NO2, SO2, PM2:5, and O3 in Beijing show that
the model can be effectively used for the short-term
prediction of air pollutant concentrations. Wang et
al.[23] proposed a hybrid Generalized AutoRegressive
Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model based
on ARIMA and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to
model panel data of air pollution and meteorological
factors, where the SVM was used to learn nonlinear
information that cannot be captured by ARIMA, and the
GARCH model was used to deal with the conditional
heteroskedasticity. Experiments on PM2:5 from six
monitoring stations in Shenzhen showed that the hybrid
model outperforms the individual models and was
a reliable and effective model for predicting PM2:5.
Ding et al.[24] employed an ARIMA-GARCH model
to make short-term forecasts of subway patronage.
The models of ARIMA and GARCH extracte the

deterministic volatility component of the passenger
Ô¨Çow seperately, and the results of prediction on three
stations showed that the performance was superior
to that of the conventional model. Moisan et al.[25]
proposed a linear model based on dynamic multiple
linear equations, which is still competitive in predicting
PM2:5 concentrations compared to nonlinear models
such as neural networks, and does not suffer from
overÔ¨Åtting and even surpasses the performance of
nonlinear models. Du et al.[26] developed an end-to-end
hybrid deep air quality prediction framework for learning
the spatial and temporal characteristics of air quality time
series data from multiple monitoring stations for PM2:5
prediction.
In addition, attention-based neural networks and graph
convolutional network based[27] air quality prediction
methods also have received extensive attention in recent
years.
2.2
Air
quality
prediction
based
on
data
decomposition
As the air quality data often changes sharply and the
traditional prediction models cannot fully utilize the
information of different frequencies of the data, some
methods based on data decomposition are proposed[28].
Fan et al.[29] proposed a hybrid prediction model
based on wavelet decomposition, using the wavelet
decomposition technique to decompose the original
air quality time series into high and low frequency
components, and then used Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) and ARIMA to predict those two components
seperately. The experimental results showed a large
improvement with respect to the single model. Based on
the data decomposition method, Jin et al.[30] decomposed
the original PM2:5 data into trend part, period part,
and residual part, and then used ARIMA and Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU) models for the prediction of the
three parts seperately. Experiments on Beijing PM2:5
data indicated that the proposed prediction model can
effectively improve the accuracy of long-term prediction.
Altƒ±ntas¬∏ and Davidson[31] combined the improved EMD
with SVR and proposed a hybrid prediction model
for short-term high-speed trafÔ¨Åc Ô¨Çow prediction. The
experimental results showed that the prediction accuracy
of the model with EMD was effectively improved
compared with the single SVR model.
A hybrid
prediction model SD-EMD-LSTM was proposed by
Zheng et al.[32] to predict electrical load. The model
clusters the power data of historical days, which are
similar to the forecast days, by the K-means algorithm
to determine the training data.
Then the model
decomposes the data by EMD and applies LSTM to
each decomposed sub-series for forecasting. Jin et al.[33]
decomposed the historical PM2:5 data through EMD.
All components were divided into three groups, the high,
medium, and low frequencies, through the convolutional
neural network CNN, and then the problem of different
numbers of components of EMD was solved. The GRU
was then used to predict each of the three frequencies.
Experiments were carried out on PM2:5 data, and the
results showed the effectiveness of the method. Huang
et al.[34] input all the smooth sequences of EMD into
GRU for training and prediction separately, while adding
meteorological features to GRU. Compared with the
single GRU model, the performance of predicting PM2:5
was signiÔ¨Åcantly improved.
Wang et al.[35] decomposed streamÔ¨Çow data by
EMD and Ensemble EMD (EEMD), and then built
ARIMA models for each sub-series separately for
prediction, and the experiments showed the effectiveness
of EMD/EEMD-ARIMA prediction models for long-
term runoff prediction. Fatema et al.[36] proposed a
hybrid forecasting method, combining EMD, ARIMA,
and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), which could learn
linear and nonlinear behavior well for medical tourism
forecasting.
However,
these works simply obtain multiple
relatively smooth components by applying EMD to
the raw series. The potential relationships between
different monitoring stations are not considered in their
studies. In addition, these methods can only predict one
pollutant concentration. To predict other pollutants, new
predictors are needed to be developed.

Methodology
To overcome the aforementioned shortcomings of
existing air quality prediction models, we propose
a novel approach named SE-ARIMA to predict all
pollutants from multiple stations at one time. The
workÔ¨Çow of our method is shown in Fig. 1, where IMF1,
IMF2, and IMF3 represent the sub-series of EMD, which
are the intrinsic mode functions. First, we treat the seven
air quality indicators from multiple stations at the current
time slot as a matrix. Therefore, historical data in recent
T time slots are treated as a matrix series. Secondly,
we use EMD to decompose each element series in the
matrix series into three smooth sub-series. Thirdly, we
use truncated SVD to remove noise in the data, then fed

the compressed matrix into the extended ARIMA model
to make predictions for the three series. Finally, we
adopt inverse EMD, i.e., summing the three sub-signals
corresponding to each air quality indicator to obtain the
Ô¨Ånal results.

Preliminaries
3.1.1
ARIMA
As a classical model, ARIMA is extensively used in
time series forecasting. Since it was proposed [37], many
variants have been presented.

series at time t, the AutoRegressive model (AR) can be
expressed as

modeled and predicted by ARIMA.
In addition, the reality is that the number of
components obtained by EMD for some sequences
is less than three, and even does not meet the initial
conditions of EMD (the results obtained by EMD for
these sequences is still the original sequences). For
this case, we add one or two series of 0 values, so that
all series satisfy the requirement of three components.
However, this approach is equivalent to introducing
noisy data, and the truncated SVD which is introduced
can solve this problem.
3.1.3
Truncated SVD
The truncated SVD provides optimal low-rank matrix
approximation for the original matrix, which can be used
to reduce matrix dimension, extract the main feature of
data, and remove data noise[14]. For a given arbitrary
matrix Z with m rows and n columns, the singular value
decomposition of the matrix Z is shown below:
Z D PÀôV T;
s.t., PP T D I; V V T D I
(5)
where the diagonal matrix Àô is a singular value matrix.
The elements of the diagonal of matrix Àô are the singular
values of Z and are arranged in the order from largest
to smallest. P and V are unitary matrices, each row and
column of which represents the left and right singular
vectors of the matrix Z, respectively. The Ô¨Årst r columns
of V are selected to construct the n  r feature matrix,
where r  min .m; n/, then the columns of the original
air-quality matrix Z can be compressed.

Experimental environment
All experiments are run on a personal computer (Intel
i7-10750H CPU, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 and
8 GB RAM). The experimental environment is Windows
10 operating system with Python3.7, and the python
extension package for deep learning is installed for
comparative experiments.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics to
measure the accuracy of the SE-ARIMA. The formulas
for these valuation metrics are as follows:

compared to the traditional ARIMA model, respectively.
That is because ARIMA can be applied to smoother
data after empirical modal decomposition, which is
exactly what the ARIMA model needs. In addition,
since SVD removes some of the inÔ¨Çuence of noisy data
on the Ô¨Ånal results and implicitly captures the correlation
between air quality at different locations, our model is
more accurate compared to the traditional ARIMA. We
Ô¨Ånd that deep learning networks LSTM works poorly
instead, probably due to overÔ¨Åtting of the model caused
by too many parameters of the deep model. The LR
and ARIMA models are superior to the LSTM, which
shows that using a linear model to predict is effective
if we only focus on the time series itself. The ARIMA
model is superior to LR, especially for future multi-step
forecasting. This is because the ARIMA model takes
into account not only the lag of past time but also the lag
of past errors.
To show the prediction performance of our method
on different air pollution indicators, we present the
evaluation results in Tables 2 and 3. The bold fonts
indicate the best results and the underlined fonts indicate
the second-best results. The RMSE and MAE of the
AQI, PM2:5, NO2, and CO in 1‚Äì2 hours predicted by
our proposed method in Tables 2 and 3 are the smallest
compared to other methods. In the Ô¨Årst two hours, the
values of the mean RMSE of the predicted AQI, PM2:5,
NO2, and CO decrease by 23.91%, 15.30%, 3.22%, and
2.21%, respectively. And the values of the mean MAE of
the predicted Ô¨Årst two steps decrease by 1.10%, 1.35%,
3.20%, and 2.43%, respectively. The RMSE and MAE of
the predicted AQI, PM2:5, and CO in the next 3‚Äì5 hours
are the smallest among all methods. For AQI, PM2:5,
and CO, the values of the RMSE decrease by 2.55%
to 26.92%, 2.77% to 16.52%, and 1.64% to 3.10%,
respectively; and the values of the MAE decrease by
0.68% to 1.36%, 1.00% to 1.96%, and 1.82% to 2.56%,
respectively. It can be seen that our proposed method can
improve the prediction accuracy of AQI, PM2:5, and CO.
The results of the other four air pollutant predictions can
also achieve better results overall. Our method achieves
the best results and can be used for long-term and short-
term forecasting.
We visualized the results of 300 hours prediction
to show intuitively the prediction performance of our
method and other methods. The comparison of the

predicted and actual values of our proposed method with
compared methods is shown in Fig. 5, from which we
can see that the predictions of SE-ARIMA are closer
to the curve of the actual values. And the results of
our proposed SE-ARIMA are better suited to the actual
value in predicting peaks and troughs. When there are
small Ô¨Çuctuations in the data, the predicted values of
ARIMA have large biases with the actual values; LR,
SVR, and LSTM have much higher predicted values than
the actual values when there are waves in the true values.
Our proposed method has a similar error in predicting
the crest, but such error is smaller than the compared
methods.
Figure 6 shows a box plot of the absolute errors of
our model and the compared methods. The error of each
method is the sum of the absolute errors of the predicted
and actual values of the seven air quality indicators from
the 34 stations. In Fig. 6, it is clear to observe that
our proposed method has the smallest absolute error
among all the methods and its distribution is in a small
range. In addition, the box plot shows that the outliers of
the absolute errors predicted by the method are smaller
compared to the baseline, and the prediction results of
our proposed method can reÔ¨Çect the true situation more
accurately.
We display the time costs required for our method
and the compared methods in Fig. 7. The time of each
method is the average cost in conducting 300 predictions
of seven air quality indicators in 34 monitoring stations.
Because the time of LSTM is too large, we truncate it in
Fig. 7. The computational time of the proposed method
is the lowest among all the compared methods, only
60.20% of the LR, and 43.66% less than the conventional
ARIMA.
In summary, our method can effectively improve
the overall accuracy of prediction and reduce the
computational time cost.

Ablation study
To demonstrate that each component in our proposed
method is effective, we perform ablation experiments
by removing a single key part of SE-ARIMA that have
the following three parts: (1) Proposal-1: The EMD
part for stationary data and the truncated SVD part for
denoising data are removed; (2) Proposal-2: The EMD

part is removed; (3) Proposal-3: The truncated SVD part
is removed.
The proposed method is compared with the above
three cases with all parameter settings being the same.
The RMSE and MAE of the prediction results on the
dataset of 34 monitoring stations in Beijing are given
in Table 4, where the bold font indicates the best result

under these evaluation metrics.
With the EMD part removed, the RMSE of PM2:5,
PM10, and O3 increase by 2.31% , 2.80% and 3.25%,
respectively. And the MAE of PM10 and O3 increase
by 1.55% and 3.05% , respectively. With the SVD part
removed, the RMSE of PM2:5, PM10, and O3 increase
by 2.77% , 3.16% and 3.62%, respectively. And the
MAE of PM10 and O3 increase by 1.80% and 3.40%,
respectively. The results of other indicators also show
a slight increase. Without the EMD component, the
prediction errors increase slightly, because the data
are not stable enough. The performance reduces more
without the truncated SVD part, which indicates that the
truncated SVD can lead to a greater improvement in the
performance of the mode. So, it is clear that each part of
the SE-ARIMA can lead to improving the performance
of overall prediction.

Conclusion
In this study, we propose a hybrid model to predict the air
quality indicators from multiple monitoring stations in
next hours. The proposed model integrated the extended
ARIMA model with the EMD method and truncated
SVD to improve air quality prediction accuracy. In detail,
EMD is used to decompose the original non-stationary
air quality indicator series into smooth sub series.
Moreover, the traditional ARIMA model is extended
to predict all air quality indicators from multiple
monitoring stations simultaneously. Experimental results
demonstrate our model outperforms state-of-art air
quality prediction models in both accuracy and time
cost.
However, there are still limitations in this study.
The main limitation is that we only use historical air

quality indicators to make prediction. Air quality is
determined by many factors, such as weather conditions
and transportation, which are not considered in our study.
In the future, we will make full use of those information
to achieve higher accuracy[39]. Furthermore, we will also
study more models, such as deep models[40] to improve
our proposed model, analyze the causal relationships
between air quality and various inÔ¨Çuencing factors
through the correlation graph[41], and make further
corrections to the predicted values through anomaly
detection[42, 43]. In practical applications, monitoring
stations are distributed in different locations, we can
consider IoT and edge computing technologies to reduce
the delay of data transmission for real-time prediction of
different stations[44, 45].
