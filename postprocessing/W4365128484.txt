Abstract—This paper presents a frequency restoration method to 
enhance power electronic dominated grid (PEDG) resiliency and 
transient response via re-defining grid following inverters (GFLIs) 
role at the grid-edge. An artificial intelligence-based power 
reference correction (AI-PRC) module is developed for GFLIs to 
autonomously adjust their power setpoints during transient 
disturbances. A detailed analytical validation is provided that 
shows control rules in PEDG intrinsically follow the underlying 
dynamic of the swing-based machines to extend its stability 
boundary. Considering this fact, comprehensive transient and 
steady state-based mathematical models are used for constructing 
the learning database of the proposed AI-PRC. The proposed 
training approach can deal with grid’s characteristics alterations 
and uncertainties. Thus, this approach incorporates PEDG’s 
effective variables that shapes its dynamic response during 
transient disturbances. Subsequently, a neural network is trained 
by Bayesian regularization algorithm (BRA) to realize the 
proposed AI-PRC scheme for frequency support via GFLIs.  
Several simulation and experimental case studies results validate 
the functionality of the proposed AI-PRC towards enhancing the 
PEDG’s transient response and resiliency via GFLIs. The 
provided case studies demonstrate significant improvement in 
frequency restoration in response to transient disturbances.

INTRODUCTION  
The increased contribution of renewable-based energy 
resources for maintaining sustainable and clean energy 
utilization in the modernized power system is affecting the grid 
conventional operation methodologies. Power electronic 
dominated grids (PEDGs) suffer from the lack of minimum 
mandatory inertia requirements for maintaining the grid stability 
[1, 2]. Specifically, frequency and voltage stability are 
vulnerable in low inertia networks [3]. Equivalent system inertia 
and short circuit ratio (SCR) are the parameters that have more 
influence on the resiliency and stability boundary of the PEDG 
[4]. Thus, system frequency, rate of change of frequency 
(ROCOF) and voltage stability may get jeopardized due to 
potential transient disturbances. Likewise, due to the 
intermittent nature of renewable energy-based sources, restoring 
the frequency excursion to the nominal is a major challenge to 
ensure stable operation of the PEDG in real-time. 
Typically, grid forming inverters (GFMIs) have the 
mainstream contributions for sustaining transient stability when 
a disturbance takes place in the system, and this is due to their 
characteristic obligations [5]. Moreover, in the steady state 
condition, GFMIs are responsible for sharing the total system 
load among each other [6]. However, these GFMIs have 
restrictions in terms of loading capacities especially when large 
disturbances occurs either on demand side or supply side. Thus, 
if they are coerced to contribute to a specific loading condition 
more than their nominal rating, the inverter cannot provide a 
proper dynamic response which could results in significant 
stability issues in PEDG. Also, having numerous GFMIs 
operating in parallel can be problematic due to the possibility of 
power circulating amongst them and synchronization challenges 
[7, 8]. However, by implementing a sort of synthetic droop 
control which is predominantly adopted from the primary 
frequency control loop of a synchronous generator (SG), the 
total load can be shared among the inverters while the grid’s 
voltage and frequency are regulated autonomously. 
On the other hand, grid following inverters (GFLIs) can be 
employed to strengthen the upstream grid voltage and frequency 
by equipping their control loops with droop fundamentals [8, 9] 
or a supervisory control system [10] instead of maximum power 
point operation [11, 12]. To benefit from the GFLIs to enhance 
system resiliency during disturbances, it is vital to add up 
another outer loop of voltage and frequency control. The active 
power is adjusted based on a thorough P-f control gain and the 
reactive power is regulated by using another gain that relates the 
voltage magnitude to the required reactive power. It is essential 
to realize accurate gains which are contingent on quite a few 
other parameters such as the grid's physical features and the 
intensity of disturbances. Irrespective of grid forming or grid 
following inverters, if the P-f droop coefficient is slightly 
decreased, the ROCOF can be intensified while faster frequency 
regulation can be achieved. Therefore, a challenging tradeoff is 
needed  in selection process of these parameters. Moreover, the 
cut-off frequency of the employed low-pass filter in control loop 
of GFLIs plays a significant role in its stability. Considering the 
same constraint for droop coefficient in GFMI and GFLI, 
varying the cut-off frequency has an explicit influence on the 
ROCOF and frequency as well. Thus, frequency and voltage 
restoration can be a challenging task in a PEDG.  
A variety of basic to advanced frequency restoration control 
approaches are developed in the literature. The notion of virtual 
synchronous generator (VSG) can be implemented in GFMI and 
GFLI to relatively damp system oscillatory transients due to the 
external disturbances with lower uncertainty regarding the 
stability violation [13]. In [14], a nonlinear control technique is 
introduced to expand the transient stability boundary which is 
extremely influenced by the frequency dynamics of the system.

outcome of the offline trained network. Also, in [21-23], multi-
agent reinforcement learning methods are explored to remove 
the centralized control approaches by estimating the frequency 
at primary and secondary levels. Still, the practical 
implementation of the proposed approaches is limited by the 
required communication infrastructure. Moreover, selecting a 
proper AI technique, as well as training and implementing 
methodologies for the targeted system are undeniable 
challenges.     
This paper proposes an artificial intelligence-based power 
reference correction (AI-PRC) technique for GFLIs to 
autonomously adjust their power setpoints during transient 
disturbances. The proposed AI-PRC technique enables fast 
frequency restoration to enhance the transient response and 
resiliency of PEDG via re-defining GFLIs role at the grid-edge. 
The proposed AI-PRC technique includes a data mining 
mechanism and real-time AI-prediction module in the control 
loop of GFLI. The data mining approach is based on a 
comprehensive transient and steady state-based analytical model 
to construct a thorough database. All PEDG physical features 
such as practical alterations in configurations, demand and 
supply side disturbances, different inertia constants, network 
natural and damping frequency related to the power angle, and 
the optimal power injection/absorption are considered in this 
approach. All feasible variables are valued based on their 
practical ranges in a realistic PEDG. In this process, different 
parameters are considered such as inertia constant, alterations in 
grid configuration (i.e., the X/R ratio), demand and supply 
disturbances, system damping coefficient, natural frequency, 
and damped natural frequency. Thereafter, the required 
injecting/ absorbing power is calculated forthrightly. After that, 
a two-layer feedforward neural network with optimal number of 
sigmoid hidden neurons and linear output neuron is learned by 
using 
the 
mathematical-driven 
database. 
A 
Bayesian 
regularization algorithm (BRA) is employed in the training stage 
to compensate the dataset size limitations, mitigate the noisy 
dataset impact, and address the other potential uncertainties. The 
real-time AI-prediction module accurately predicts frequency 
trajectory when a transient disturbance occurs in the system. 
Thus, the proposed methodology scrutinizes frequency 
eccentricities during wide range of  disturbances. The proposed 
methodology is employed in the control loop of GFLIs to ensure 
resilient operation of PEDG under disturbances. Thus, the main 
contribution of this paper is to address the shortcomings of 
frequency restoration among the state-of-the-art VSG-based or 
droop-based GFLIs and GFMIs via re-defining GFLI role at 
grid-edge equipped with the proposed AI-PRC.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 
II provides a description of considered system and PEDG 
dynamic fundamentals. Section III discusses the proposed data 
mining methodology. Section IV details technical aspects of the 
training mechanism. In Section V, simulation and experimental 
validation are provided.  Section VI concludes the paper.

PEDG PREVAILING DYNAMICAL FUNDAMENTALS 
A. Considered System Overview 
Fig. 1 represents the considered PEDG that is an IEEE 14-
bus system. Seven GFLIs and one relatively small SG are 
contributing to support system loading. The total amount of load 
in this study is 500 kW. SG output power in steady state is 
limited to 150 kVA while its power rating is 800 kVA. As 
planned, 350 kW of system demand is supplied by renewable 
inertial value cannot be assumed as a constant and a correlation 
should be established between the frequency excursion and 
inertia constant.  In fact, the performance of the proposed 
approach in [14] doesn’t properly meet the IEEE 1547 standard 
regarding the ROCOF constraints. Consequently, it is crucial to 
have a faster frequency detection scheme. A droop-based 
approach in combination with ROCOF control for providing the 
active power set point in the event of frequency excursion is 
presented in [15] with the goal of adopting SG-based frequency 
control with extensive mechanical and electrical models. It is 
worthy to mention that the conventional droop and VSG based 
controls are not able to pick up the load for distinct dynamic 
characteristics either in grid-tied or standalone mode of 
operation at the same time. 
A comparison has been conducted on the dynamic response 
of VSG and droop-based control schemes in [16, 17]. Both 
control approaches are based on the droop fundamentals. It 
should be noticed that a droop-based control characteristically 
does not emulate system inertia. Nevertheless, by employing 
delay in their control loops, the system can emulate the virtual 
inertia. As mentioned in [18], VSG and inertia droop-based 
controls can take the advantage of the droop features and 
simultaneously add virtual inertia to the operating grid. 
However, the response of the VSG is more oscillatory compared 
to the droop-based techniques during system transients [16]. 
Also, the droop control suffers from its inherent drawbacks 
under large disturbances in the system. In [19] a generalized 
droop control is presented for supporting the grid. The power 
loop in this approach is adaptive to different conditions and 
enables the control system to provide virtual inertia and damping 
factor in standalone conditions. Moreover, in grid-connected 
mode, the fluctuations in the output power are reduced. 
Nevertheless, the drawbacks of tuning and designing optimal 
controller gains and droop coefficient could limit control 
functionalities especially if the network configuration is altered, 
or a large disturbance occurs. 
Due to the high level of nonlinearity in PEDG and 
aforementioned shortcomings in the operational methodologies, 
it is worthy to mention that the conventional droop and VSG 
based controls have shortcomings to pick up the load for distinct 
dynamic characteristics either in grid-tied or standalone mode of 
operation at the same time. Whereas artificial intelligence (AI)-
based techniques sound more attractive to address the challenges 
in enhancing resiliency and improving transient response in low 
inertia power systems [20]. AI techniques can cope up with 
multi-objective optimization problems such as frequency and 
voltage restorations. Moreover, AI can dynamically learn the 
demand of power during load or generation disturbances to 
rapidly restore the frequency of the system and prevents low 
frequency-nadirs and high ROCOFs. This will ultimately 
prevent the system from cascaded failures and blackouts, thus 
increasing the system resiliency. In fact, AI techniques are 
believed as a suitable potential to accommodate complicated 
dynamic modification of the system. Specifically, this feature of 
AI will help to improve the transient response in low-inertia 
power system such as PEDG. 
Consequently, an AI-based frequency control is presented in 
[20] which focuses on an isolated hydro power plant. This 
methodology is valid for isolated plants where the required data 
are available for training. Therefore, the training process does 
not cover all the system incidents. Besides, any modification in 
the network configuration will have negative impacts on the

resources which is equivalent to 70% of the total system load, 
representing a highly renewable energy penetrated grid. The 
considered network has two voltage levels at 13.8 kV and 380 
V. Furthermore, it can operate in islanded mode from upstream 
network at 69 kV via a circuit breaker installed at substation 
location of bus #10. 
B. MPC based GFLI control 
provide the active power reference for the MPC based GFLI 
controller. Furthermore, the reactive power reference can be set 
zero for unity power factor operation or as per system 
requirement. For the three-phase GFLI, there are 8 switching 
vectors and for each vector the cost function is calculated. The 
switching vector that represents the minimum value of the cost 
function is selected as the optimized vectors and the output of 
the MPC based voltage controller. Hence, based on this input 
from the AI, the MPC scheme tracks the active power reference 
to adjust active power injection to support the frequency. 
C. PEDG Dynamic Fundamentals 
This section provides a brief overview of MPC formulation [24,

This shows that the droop-based control can be equated as 
VSG-based control which follows the fundamentals of swing 
equation. Thus, it is proved that the prevailing dynamic of 
network of GFMIs and GFLIs, representing an islanded cluster 
of PEDG, follows the swing equation rule either they have 
VSG-based or droop-based control schemes.  This fact, swing 
equation as the dominant dynamic response rule in PEDG, is 
used for initiating the data mining in this paper as detailed in

PROPOSED DATA MINING METHODOLOGY 
To provide a comprehensive dataset regarding feasible 
impending variations in the grid such as PEDG’s physical 
feature or different disruption types, transient and steady-state 
intervals should be investigated accurately. The overall system 
resiliency cannot be achieved without considering both the 
steady state and transient stability. Thus, the data mining 
approach in this paper is based on both steady state and 
transient dynamics by analyzing and determining solutions of 
the swing equation as the dominant dynamic response rule in 
PEDG which is validated in the previous section.  
A. Frequency dynamic in steady state condition  
The steady state and transient dynamics of the PEDG is 
analyzed to provide a thorough database to cover primary and 
secondary frequency responses. These procedures assure that 
all events would be monitored and captured mathematically in 
a database that is exploited for learning a neural network. The 
final objective is to predict the PEDG frequency trajectory and 
provide an optimal power reference correction for GFLIs in real 
time. This real-time power correction is corresponding to the 
adjustment of accelerating power in conventional power 
systems by SGs contributions all over the grid. The intrinsic 
dynamics of PEDG during typical disturbances such as addition

The natural and damped frequencies and damping ratio are 
extracted from (13) and given in (14). Therefore, PEDG as a 
nonlinear system has natural frequency which has influence on 
the nodal voltages, global frequency, and the amount of power 
contribution from each DER. Furthermore, natural frequency is 
affected reversely by H while the damping ratio has a direct 
relation with damping factor. As expected, by increasing the 
inertia constant, damping ratio of the PEDG is decreased. Thus, 
the generalized power angle equation can provide a 
comprehensive database for frequency and ROCOF dynamic if 
the input variables are valued in a feasible and practical range.  
B. Transient frequency dynamic during severe disturbances  
By contemplating potential severe disturbances and degree 
of nonlinearities in PEDG, the steady state frequency analysis 
would not be pertinent to assess the PEDG dynamic. In other 
words, when the disturbance is extensive, common, and 
straightforward solutions are not reasonable for a highly 
coupled nonlinear differential equation. The PEDG dynamic 
facing with a severe disturbance is obtained by using Euler 
arithmetical methodology. In this approach, some adjustments 
which are based on prediction and correction techniques are 
applied. Basically, (10) can be divided in two first-order 
differential equation as,

The predicted solutions are found for each equation and 
denoted by subscript N. Also, a corrective action is carried out 
on the predicted values and shown by subscript c. At the state 
of k+1, the predicted values for power angle are given by, 
where Pm is the per unit value of the inverters’ input powers and 
Pe represents the output electrical power respectively. H is the 
virtual inertia constant, and δ is the electrical power angle. Any 
deviation in ∆𝜔 results in different frequency dynamic and 
ROCOF based on the PEDG inertia constant. For evaluating the 
inherent dynamic of this equation, a general perturbation such 
as 𝛿 ൌ ∆𝛿 ൅ 𝛿଴  is applied on the power angle, which is 
corresponded to a normal disturbance, (10) is approximated in 
term of angle perturbation by,

A. AI Training description 
Once a comprehensive dataset is formed, an artificial neural 
network (ANN) is needed to be trained for predicting the 
required corrective accelerating power to support the grid under 
different disturbances. The trained network, predict PEDG 
inertia based on the frequency trajectory and ROCOF and find 
an optimal power to restore frequency excursion in a timely 
manner. Typically, AI-based approaches suffer from lack of 
required database size, non-optimal regularization parameters, 
heterogenous datasets, overfitting problems and potential 
uncertain inputs. Using Bayesian regularization in the learning 
algorithm of ANN, enhances the training performance by 
finding the optimal parameters during training process. In BRA, 
defining a cost function is required to adaptively decide on 
terminating the training process based on different problem 
objectives and regularization parameters. A typical problematic 
issue in feed forward neural networks (NN) is regarded to 
overfitting challenges that have direct influence on the network 
weights. This results in poor neural network generalization when 
they get new input data. The best method to resolve this issue is 
to regularize the estimation process. This is carried out by 
inflicting a penalty factor on the network cost function. Based 
on the problem objective in this work, the inputs are system 
frequency and ROCOF while target dataset includes the required 
corrective active power to stabilize the PEDG under applied 
disturbances. Training datasets are given by,

Fig. 3. Error histogram of the trained ANN. 
Getting the optimum parameters based on the training dataset 
structure, ensures high prediction accuracy of the trained 
network while enable the network to deal with noisy and small 
datasets with uncertain dynamic of inputs. 
B. AI Training process 
The ANN training requires about 1000 epochs using BRA 
as discussed in section IV-A. This algorithm typically requires 
lesser memory than the other techniques however at the cost of 
longer training times. Training automatically stops when 
generalization stops improving, as indicated by a decrease in 
the mean squared error (MSE) measure of the validation 
samples. As mentioned previously, frequency and ROCOF for 
different scenarios are used as inputs in the (12) and (15) to 
determine the accelerating power Pcorr required. The solutions 
of (12) and (15) for different fg and ROCOF inputs are used to 
generate a database as given by (20) that is fed as training data 
to the ANN. These design considerations make the trained 
ANN quick and robust in determining the accelerating power 
required. The MSE plotted in Fig. 2 is used as the merit to 
validate the performance accuracy of the trained ANN. As 
evident, after completion of the training process the MSE 
approaches zero. 
The database is divided randomly so that training process 
uses 70%, testing uses 15% and validation uses 15% of the data. 
Furthermore, the selection of number of hidden layer neurons 
is based on a trade-off between the ANN’s response time and 
accuracy. This value is specific to the system and is optimized 
to two hidden layers with 11 neurons in first hidden layer and 
two neurons in the second layer. An error histogram is plotted 
in Fig. 3 to show the performance obtained with the developed 
ANN. Finally, about 150,000 sample data are fed as input and 
target datasets to train the network. 
V. CASE STUDIES AND VALIDATION 
PEDG. Specifically, the experimental hardware setup has two 
DERs, that are controlled as GFMI and GFLI feeding their local 
loads of 22  and 30  respectively. The interconnection 
between GFMI and GFLI is established via a line impedance.  
A. Simulation Case Studies – 14-Bus Network 
Several cases studies are simulated and assessed: i) extensive 
power generation loss in the grid due to potential external grid 
disturbances, ii) generation loss in a reconfigured grid topology, 
iii) load decrease in the reconfigured grid, iv) comparative case 
study of the proposed AI-PRC with state-of-the-art VSG and 
reverse droop-based control schemes for frequency restoration, 
v) robustness to model parameter mismatch. Furthermore, all 
case studies, thorough comparisons are presented with and 
without the proposed approach in PEDG. 
Case Study I: In this scenario, the 14-bus PEDG’s DERs are 
driving the total load during steady state. GFLIs are feeding the 
loads based on their pre-defined power set points. For evaluating 
the efficacy of the proposed AI-PRC based frequency 
restoration methodology, one of the GFLIs is equipped with the 
proposed AI-PRC. In case study I, a 200 kW generation loss 
occurs on PEDG when all DERs are unequipped with the AI-
PRC. As expected, a considerable frequency drop is detected at 
the time of transient disturbance. Generation loss transpired at 
instant of t = 8 s. Fig. 4 (a) illustrates the grid’s frequency before 
and after this disturbance in the considered system without and 
with the AI-PRC module enabled. As shown, in the system 
without AI, a frequency drop of 3 Hz is observed in red plot. In 
this scenario, SG is the main contributor to governing the 
voltage and frequency particularly in the black start and during 
grid potential disturbances. Here, frequency is restored by the 
SG’s governor at the nominal value after 4 s. Moreover, the 
nadir frequency drops below 57 Hz which most probably 
triggers the protection relays. Comparatively, when the GFLI#6 
is equipped with the proposed AI-PRC and during the event of 
loss of generation, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), the frequency is 
restored in timely manner indicated by blue plot. Considering 
the training mechanism, the power correction value is increased 
to 200 kW which shows the accuracy of the proposed AI-PRC. 
At the same time, SG is increasing the output power gradually 
due to its slower dynamic response. As SG power increases, the 
The functionality of the proposed AI-based technique for 
enhancing the transient response and resiliency of PEDG is 
validated on two main setups: (i) an IEEE 14-bus network 
shown in Fig. 1 that represents a realistic PEDG in 
MATLAB/Simulink 
environment, 
(ii) 
a 
small-scale

kW of this DER, the maximum power contribution of this DER 
is confined to 30 kW. Line 14 was being operated at MV voltage 
level and line 4 was at LV level. As a result, it is anticipated that 
the power flow in the line 11 increases due to the power 
AI-PRC adjusts the power reference setpoint of the GFLI 
accordingly to its default value in about 4 s. Comparatively with 
AI-PRC module, the nadir frequency has improved by 2 Hz and 
the time required for frequency restoration is decreased by about 
1332 ms when the GFLI supports the grid during transients. Fig. 
4 (b) shows the correction value of active power that should be 
added to the power set point of GFLI to support the frequency 
during the transients. Moreover, Fig. 4 (c) shows the dynamic of 
active power injected via AI-PRC equipped GFLI#6 and this 
accurately follows its reference. Fig. 4 (d) illustrates the output 
current dynamics of GFLI#6 during the occurred disturbance. 
Similar to the corrected power reference, the current increases 
in three stages and converge to its nominal value after the 
disturbance is damped. Fig. 4 (e) provides exhaustive 
information regarding instantaneous ROCOF for with and 
without AI-PRC frequency restoration scenarios. As indicated, 
the maximum ROCOF is 13.48 Hz/s when the AI-PRC is 
deployed in the control loop of GFLI. This value reaches 25.18 
Hz/s when GFLI does not contribute to frequency restoration. 
Fig. 4 (f) demonstrates that the average ROCOF improves 
approximately twice the time the AI-PRC approach is not 
employed in the GFLI’s control loops. As indicated, the 
maximum average ROCOF is -8.6 Hz/s when the AI-PRC is 
deployed in the control loop of GFLI. This value reaches -16 
Hz/s when GFLI does not contribute to frequency restoration.  
Case Study II: To generalize the functionality of the 
proposed approach in grid support during severe transient 
disturbances, the grid structure is reconfigured and the limitation 
of the GFLI power rating is considered during their frequency 
restoration contribution in this case study. This physical 
variation would have explicit impact on the X/R ratio of the grid 
and the short circuit ratio (SCR). Both can affect the dynamic 
response of the grid during severe disturbances. The scenario 
provided in this case study thus validates that the trained neural 
network is well generalized and can predict the frequency 
trajectory when the physically modified understudy grid is 
confronted with severe transient disturbances. As shown in Fig. 
1, two different transmission lines located in critical points of 
two different voltage level clusters committed to be 
disconnected. The employed modification alters the basic power 
flow paths remarkably. Assuming the power ratings are not 
jeopardized in this scenario after reconfiguration, a 120-kW 
power generation loss occurs in the understudy 14-bus network. 
Here, the GFLI at bus 13 will support the grid in transients. This 
DER has a power rating of 80 kW. Based on the local load of 50

contribution from GFLI#6. Fig. 5 (a) illustrates the frequency 
excursion dynamic before and after this disturbance. As shown, 
the frequency is restored beyond 59.9 Hz around 76 ms while 
the frequency nadir differences with nominal value is kept in the 
band of 0.23 Hz. Fig. 5 (b) shows the power contribution of the 
GFLI during the transient by following the power correction AI-
PRC’s command shown in Fig. 5 (c). As shown, the maximum 
power contribution is around 20-30 kW to go along with the 
power rating restriction. The ROCOF during the transients is in 
an acceptable range as depicted in Fig. 5 (d). The current 
dynamic of this inverter is illustrated in Fig 5 (e). As shown, the 
current increases based on the dynamic change of power 
reference. Hence, this case study highlights the effective 
contribution of GFLIs in frequency restoration even by 
considering inverter power rating limitations and grid 
reconfiguration scenario. 
Case Study III: this case study analyzes the impact of an 
unplanned demand outage. At instant t = 7 s, 135 kW load is 
decreased. The grid is reconfigured, the location of the 
supportive GFLI is changed (located at bus#2) and the total 
inertia of the grid is modified. Although the entire inertia of the 
grid is an unknown parameter, by modifying the SG’s inertia 
constant, total grid inertia would be affected, and this case study 
can be an operational assessment of the trained neural network 
in the frequency trajectory prediction practice. As expected, the 
AI module ought to deliver a negative power reference to adjust 
the GFLI power reference in a way that power injection to the 
grid decreases although the inverter should sustain its local load 
of 35 kW. In a steady state, the power injection was around 100 
kW when the unplanned demand outage occurred. Frequency 
and ROCOF dynamics are captured and assessed in Fig. 6 (a) 
and (b) correspondingly. In more detail, a comparison of 
frequency dynamics with and without deploying the AI-PRC in 
GFLI control loops for the similar disturbance is shown by red 
and blue plots respectively. As shown, frequency is controlled 
lower than 60.5 Hz in 380ms. The frequency peak is suppressed 
considerably when deploying the proposed approach. A 
considerable improvement in ROCOF of 5 Hz/s is observed by 
deploying the proposed AI-PRC (see Fig. 6 (b)). Fig. 6 (c) 
shows the power dynamic of the GFLI. As expected, the 
injected power is decreased and reached to a new level while 
the predefined constraints of inverter local load power is not 
jeopardized.  The disturbance is restrained by 2.5 s during the 
time that SG declines its output power to make up a new supply-
demand. Fig. 6 (d) shows the inverter current dynamics during 
the grid support. The current gets the minimum acceptable 
value by 200 ms to dampen the disturbance and raises to the 
nominal value after about 130 ms.  
Case Study IV: In this case study, we consider a network of 
a GFMI and a GFLI that are connected as shown in Fig. 9 (b).

Case study V: In this case study, the impact of model 
parameter mismatch on the practicality and capability of the 
proposed AI-PRC which uses an MPC-based modulator to 
generate the switching sequences is studied. The absolute 
reference tracking error of the active power for the introduced 
mismatch of ±20 % in the values of L1, L2, and Cf is represented 
in Fig. 8 (a). Total harmonic distortion (THD) of the output 
current of the GFLI with the proposed AI-PRC under the same 
mismatch is also depicted in Fig. 8 (b). As it is shown in this 
case study, the proposed AI-PRC is robust to model parameter 
mismatch.   
B. Experimental Case Studies 
The functionality of the proposed AI-PRC scheme is also 
validated experimentally on a small-scale hardware setup 
depicted in Fig. 9 (a). The schematic diagram of the connection 
between GFMI and GFLI is illustrated in Fig. 9 (b). The 
understudy hardware emulates a realistic dynamic of a network 
of GFMI and GFLIs islanded cluster. Thus, voltage and 
frequency are built and controlled via a relatively low-inertia 
VSG-based GFMI. Also, a GFLI contributes to support the 
local load. The specifications of the hardware components are 
This case study compares the transient response of frequency 
for three different frequency restoration schemes: VSG, droop-
based, and the proposed AI-PRC scheme.  Fig. 7 (a) represents 
the frequency response obtained from the various compared 
GFLI control schemes in response to a load step change of 
100%. The results show that the network experiences the least 
frequency deviation with the value of 0.15 Hz (blue plot) when 
equipped with the proposed AI-PRC while the frequency 
deviations observed for other methods are 0.85 Hz (green plot 
for VSG-based control scheme) and 0.9 Hz (red plot for reverse 
droop-based control scheme). It is worth mentioning that the 
frequency restoration times required for each method are 3 s 
(for VSG-based), 0.6 s (reverse droop-based), and 0.4 s (for 
proposed AI-PRC). These results indicate the superiority of the 
proposed AI-PRC scheme in terms of minimum restoration

listed in Table. I. The GFLI and GFMI controllers are 
implemented in dSPACE Microlabox.  
Case Study VI: In this case study, the superiority of the 
proposed AI-PRC approach is validated.  In the first scenario, 
the frequency restoration is performed by the governor 
(conventional PI-based) control loop of the VSG based GFMI 
while in the second scenario the GFLI is equipped with the AI-
PRC module to support restoring the frequency during the load 
disturbance.  Specifically, a step load of around 1500 W is 
applied on the grid. Fig. 10 (a) illustrates the frequency 
dynamics with VSG based frequency restoration scheme. As 
shown, the system frequency is restored to the nominal value. 
However, the restoration time is around 11.45 s in this low 
inertia grid, and this is due to the drawbacks of PI-based control 
approaches. High proportional and integral gains can enhance 
the restoration time, but those cannot be employed in practice. 
Indeed, if a severe load disturbance occurs, the frequency drop 
will push the protection relays to be triggered instantaneously. 
Comparatively in the second scenario when GFLI is equipped 
with the AI-PRC module for the frequency restoration support, 
Fig. 10 (b) demonstrates system frequency dynamics. As 
shown, the frequency is restored to the nominal value of 60 Hz 
within 430 ms which is about 26 times faster as compared to 
the VSG approach, considering the severity of the disturbance. 
Furthermore, Fig. 10 (c) illustrate the output power dynamics 
of GFLI with the proposed AI-PRC. The system supports the 
extra load of 1.5 kW within 500 ms. Finally, the Fig. 10 (d) 
shows the PCC voltage profile. Thus, the effectiveness of 
proposed scheme is validated experimentally. This case study 
shows the importance of re-defining the GFLI’s role at grid-
edge in handling transient disturbances.   
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes re-defining the role of GFLIs at the grid-
edge via an AI-PRC mechanism to enhance the transient 
response and resiliency of PEDG. A two-layer feedforward 
ANN is learned by the Bayesian regularization algorithm which 
facilitates the AI-PRC module to predict system frequency 
trajectory and provide the proper amount of correction power 
for GFLIs when the grid is subjected to disturbances. GFLI and 
GFMI dynamic is extensively analyzed to create an accurate 
data mining approach for the training of the ANN. Several 
simulation and experimental case studies are provided that 
demonstrate significant improvement in transient response and 
resiliency in comparison with state-of-the-art frequency 
restoration mechanism.
