Abstract: Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) is an irreversible and neurodegenerative disease that slowly impairs memory
and neurocognitive function, but the etiology of AD is still unclear. With the explosive growth of electronic health
data, the application of artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare setting provides excellent potential for exploring
etiology and personalized treatment approaches, and improving the disease‚Äôs diagnostic and prognostic outcome.
This paper Ô¨Årst brieÔ¨Çy introduces AI technologies and applications in medicine, and then presents a comprehensive
review of AI in AD. In simple, it includes etiology discovery based on genetic data, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD),
computer-aided prognosis (CAP) of AD using multi-modality data (genetic, neuroimaging and linguistic data), and
pharmacological or non-pharmacological approaches for treating AD. Later, some popular publicly available AD
datasets are introduced, which are important for advancing AI technologies in AD analysis. Finally, core research
challenges and future research directions are discussed.

Introduction
Dementia is a clinical syndrome; it is manifested as
a progressive deterioration of cognitive function, such
as memory, the ability to pay attention and language
skills, and a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms and
related behavioral disorders, resulting in impaired daily
life and activities[1‚Äì3]. Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) is one
of the primary causes of dementia in the world. It is
estimated that a 95% incidence rate of AD occurs in

individuals over 65 years old and will increase with age.
For subjects aged between 65‚Äì69 years old and older
than 85 years old, the incidence of AD is 0.6% and
8.4%[4], respectively.
The progression of AD is different for each
individual. AD patients live approximately 4‚Äì8 years
after diagnosis[5]. According to World Alzheimer Report,
over 50 million peoples were living with this disease
worldwide in 2019. The Ô¨Ågure will increase to 152
million by 2050, which means that one person develops
Alzheimer‚Äôs every three seconds. Based on the risk of
onset, AD is broadly classiÔ¨Åed into three stages:
(1) The preclinical stage describes a person with
signs of pathology on brain images, such as cerebral
amyloidosis. Still, it has no cognitive symptoms (in the
impairment level of very mild cognitive decline).
(2) Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
have brain changes and subtle symptoms in this stage.
(3) Dementia, severe cognitive impairment, and
noticeable brain changes appear in this stage.
The AD burden will escalate with an increased risk,
and the treatment options will switch to limited. Usually,
progress from MCI to dementia is needed over the years,

and not all patients with MCI will convert to dementia,
even though there is currently no cure for this disease[6].
But the probability is higher for MCI patients to develop
dementia than those without MCI. Therefore, improving
the diagnosis rates is essential so individuals with high
risk can be detected earlier to prevent or reduce future
progression.
As a standard tool that used for brain pathology
assessment and structural lesions exclusion (e.g., tumor
and infarction), the neuroimaging can be mainly divided
into two categories[7]. The Ô¨Årst category is structural
imaging, such as Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)[7, 8]. CT utilizes
X-rays to reveal the two dimensional structure of brain,
and MRI generates pictures of tissues inside the brain
through radio waves and strong magnetic Ô¨Åeld. When the
neurologic examination has no abnormal Ô¨Åndings, CT
is adequate for progressive cognitive decline detection.
However, if a patient has motor dysfunction, the MRI
might be adopted to recognize ischemic changes which
cannot be identiÔ¨Åed by CT. The second category is
functional imaging, such as functional MRI (fMRI) and
Positron Emission Tomography (PET)[9, 10]. fMRI is
a non-invasive technique, which uses MRI to measure
hemodynamic changes caused by neuronal activity, and
can show the neuronal active and functioning part of
brain. PET is a nuclear medical imaging technique
that utilizes radioactive substance to identity functional
changes of brain and generates a three-dimensional
image. Apart from neuroimaging, neuropsychological
assessment can help to indicate the extent of deÔ¨Åcits
with higher precision for differential diagnosis. Recent
researches show that language and memory impairment
are crucial signs of AD, such as difÔ¨Åcultly recalling
names and Ô¨Ånding suitable words to represent in
spontaneous speech. The language of AD individuals
is characterized by generating grammar errors and
increased frequency of sound disruption and self-
correction. Gene and cerebrospinal Ô¨Çuid (CSF) detection
provides the reference for AD diagnosis; for example,
mutations of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene
and PS1 and PS2 genes account for 50% of familial early-
onset AD. Therefore neuroimaging, neuropsychological
examination, and genes play an essential role in AD
detection.
The
essential
goals
of
AD
research
include
discovering the factors that cause the disease, so that
the disease‚Äôs detection and prediction process can
be established efÔ¨Åciently by exploring personalized
treatment approaches[11, 12]. As shown in the Fig. 1.
The workÔ¨Çow of traditional AD diagnosis includes
three stages, i.e., doctor visits, body examination, and
diagnosis. During the doctor visits stage, the basic
information of each patient asked by doctors including
symptoms, disease history, and family history etc. Then,
the various items are checked according to the primary
diagnosis of doctor, such as laboratory test, and imaging
test, etc. Finally, the clinical diagnoses are produced
according to produced test results. Traditional process
rely on the clinician‚Äôs knowledge and experience for test
result analysis, and then for subsequent diagnosis. First,
the various tests might produce high volume results,
requiring a large amount of workload for clinicians to
analyze, and the error-prone results might be generated
since the physician‚Äôs knowledge and experience are
subjective and occasionally unreliable. Secondly, due

to the fact that the complicate interactions among many
factors in neurobiological and immunological processes
are involved, it is difÔ¨Åcult to utilize a simpliÔ¨Åed model
to understand the aetiology and then provide clues for
researching solutions of reversible treatment as well as
prevention of AD[13, 14].
ArtiÔ¨Åcial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology
for various medical purposes, such as medical decision-
making[15]. Comparing to traditional workÔ¨Çow of
diagnosis that heavily relies on human labors, AI enable
the automation of the diagnostic process. As shown in
the Fig. 1. First, the basic information and test results
are collected as the input data for AI models. Then,
the discriminative features are identiÔ¨Åed by AI models
from the input data to generate diagnostic results.
Finally, doctors will produce the Ô¨Ånal diagnosis with
potential reference to interaction with the suggestive
decision that derived from the AI models, which
have the potentials for enhancing the quality of the
clinical decision-making. Based on the diagnostic
results, we can design personalized treatment options
for improving the cognitive ability of AD patients.
Moreover, since AI techniques can learn the complexity
or abstraction patterns from large-sample data resources,
deeper investigation of molecular mechanisms using
AI approaches can be led to large-scale and high-
throughput analysis of transcriptome, genome, and
gene-gene interactions. Based on the signiÔ¨Åcance of
AI in AD research, this paper aims to conduct an
extensive and comprehensive review to explore and
discuss the role of AI techniques in etiology discovery,
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of AD that will
inspire future evidence-based medicine research and
practical applications. In the rest of the paper, we Ô¨Årst
introduce the AI techniques and their applications in
the medical domain in Section 2. Then the machine
learning approaches in etiology discovery, diagnosis,
prognosis, and treatment are summarized in Section 3. In
Section 4, we introduce some popular publicly available
AD datasets. In Section 5, we discuss the challenges
and try to provide an insight into solutions in the future
research direction. Finally, the conclusion is given in
Section 6.

Applications of ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence in
Medicine
learning methods mainly include supervised, semi-
supervised, and unsupervised approaches[18, 19]. The
supervised approaches rely on fully labeled data to
construct a classiÔ¨Åer, and the classical algorithms include
Support Vector Machine (SVM)[20], Bayesian Network
(BN)[21], and ArtiÔ¨Åcial Neural Network (ANN)[22].
Considering the data labeling is a time-consuming
and labor-intensive task, the semi-supervised approach
is proposed, which utilizes iterative and bootstrap
learning to build a classiÔ¨Åer from a small set of
annotated data. Although Semi-Supervised Learning
(SSL) provides great potentials to reduce the workload
of data annotation, the fact that the classiÔ¨Åer is
sensitive to the biased samples in the initial labeled data
limits the application of SSL[23]. Unsupervised learning
algorithms do not need labeled data, and they utilize
statistical information from unlabeled data to learn
inherent patterns for classiÔ¨Åer construction. The typical
unsupervised learning is data clustering which includes
hierarchical clustering, distance clustering, and K-means,
etc., which enable the large-scale data analysis, but the
result has no standard form and is hard to interpret[24, 25].
Later, some researches integrated the advantages of
supervised and unsupervised learning, and proposed
reinforcement learning-based approaches[26‚Äì28]. These
traditional machine learning methods need careful
engineering and expert knowledge to build a feature
extractor, which transforms raw data into a suitable
internal feature vector used by the classiÔ¨Åer to discover
patterns from the input data. They are limited in their
ability of raw data processing[29] since the feature
engineering is a complicated task, which in many cases
cannot Ô¨Ånd the appropriate feature set for the high
quality classiÔ¨Åer building. Recently, deep learning, a
speciÔ¨Åc subset of machine learning, has becoming a hot
topic, which allows a machine to automatically detect
the multi-level feature representations for classiÔ¨Åcation.
A deep learning network composed of multiple non-
linear modules that transform the raw input into higher
and more abstract feature representations. The complex
function can be learned by composition of enough
transformations. In the medical domain, the broad
adoption of healthcare information systems has caused
an explosive growth of diverse biological data, such as
medical images and text. Using AI tools to facilitate
medical analysis and solutions is a promising and
essential area.
Research on AI in the medical domain began after
the naming of AI in 1956[30]. With the development
Machine learning is a branch of AI that focuses

study AI-aid biomarker discovery, and 5% adopt AI
approaches for AD treatment.
Among these, 4%
of articles construct one model for diagnoses and
prediction tasks. We found that the AD CAD system
has received more research attentions than other AD
applications. Two points could explain the reason.
First, most of the existing public AD datasets involve
diagnostic status, which can be used as the ground truth
to train a diagnostic model. Second, difference from
etiology discovery and treatment, the basis of diagnostic
AD at a different stage has consensus.

of information technology and the explosive growth
of diverse clinical data in recent years, study on
applications of AI in the medical domain has received
increased attention from researchers. According to Refs.
[31, 32], the automatic diagnosis and prediction of the
disease are the main utilizes of AI. In recent years, AI
has been widely used to diagnose various diseases. For
instance, Yu et al.[33] developed a diagnostic model using
an auxiliary preserve denoising autoencoders model to
Ô¨Ålter key features from image and blood test data. The
selected features are inputted into the classiÔ¨Åer for breast
cancer classiÔ¨Åcation, and it achieved 88% accuracy, 91%
speciÔ¨Åcity and a 0.86 F1 score. Xu et al.[34] proposed a
novel network that consists of a global-level attention
network and a local-level attention network to classify
cataracts using retinal fundus images. It obtains an
accuracy of 90.65% on two class detection tasks. Zheng
et al.[35] employed a 3D CNN model and chest CT
images to classify COVID-19 and non-COVID-19; this
model achieves an AUC of 0.959, a sensitivity of 90.7%,
and a speciÔ¨Åcity of 91.1%.
For other medical applications, Fritz et al.[36] built a
multipath CNN model for prediction of postoperative
mortality by adopting preoperative lab values, patient
characteristics, etc. By comparing multiple machine
learning methods, including deep neural networks,
logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and
SVM, the results show that multipath CNN utilized
LSTM better than other approaches. The above research
has shown that using machine learning methods to
analyze different medical data beneÔ¨Åts healthcare. It
demonstrates that adopting AI approaches in medical
facilities can help improve the quality of medical
applications in developing countries to help clinicians
with insufÔ¨Åcient experience.

Applications of AI in AD Analysis
One of the signiÔ¨Åcant goals of AD research is etiology
studies, which discover risk factors that cause AD.
The etiology discovery results can provide clues for
studying AD‚Äôs diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. A
previous study reported that the cause of AD is related
to several factors, such as increasing age, environmental
factors, genetic factors, etc[37, 38]. Aging is a signiÔ¨Åcant
risk factor for AD cases, and most AD patients have
a late onset after 65 years old. AD can be classiÔ¨Åed
into two types based on age. First, early-onset AD
(EOAD), which accounts for 1%‚Äì6% of all AD cases,
the age ranges from 30 to 60 or 65. The second type
is late-onset AD (LOAD), which commonly appears
with age above 65 years old. Both these two types may
occur in a person with a family with a positive history
of AD[39]. AD onset occurs in women and men, but
about two-thirds of AD patients are women. Several
types of research reported that neurodegeneration and
clinical symptoms appear more rapidly in women than
men once diagnosed[40]. Some of the work found that
AI technology, especially machine learning, has shown
effectiveness for large-scale, high-dimensional, and
complex data analysis. According to the clinical studies
on AD[12], we provide an overview of recent research
on AI-aid etiology discovery, diagnosis, prognosis, and
treatment of AD. Around a hundred publications were
retrieved from the google scholar website to Ô¨Ånd the
relevant studies of AI-aid biomarker discovery, CAD,
and CAP systems on AD published in English from
January 2018 to date.

SLC25A46, RAE1 and non-encoding RNA genes
BC037880, and AK057435. Zakeri et al.[54] discovered
gene factors of AD by building co-expression networks
using gene expression data from three stages of AD
(normal, MCI and AD). This research discovered eight
genes and Ô¨Åve miRNAs as AD biomarkers.
Wang
et al.[60] incorporate statistical and machine learning
methods to identify diagnostic biomarkers of AD by
combining gene expression data from six brain regions.
A total of 44 genes, such as CEL, TNNI3, APOH,
FABP2 et al., are discovered as essential biomarkers of
AD, and the blood biomarkers are also signiÔ¨Åcant for
AD diagnosis. Gene-gene interactions have essential
roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Chen et al.[61] used a
machine learning framework named joint density-based
non-parametric differential interaction network analysis
and classiÔ¨Åcation to analyze gene expression data, which
not only focuses on the genetic variations associated
with AD but also on relationships between gene products.
For example, the research found that CALML3 affects
the onset of AD because CALML3 is contained in the
transport of Ca2C, and Ca2C can affect AD. From the
above research, it can be demonstrated that machine
learning algorithm has essential advantages in analyzing
molecular mechanisms and complex networks of genetic
interactions. Huang et al.[62] discovered the full genome
spectrum of AD utilizing a machine learning model
based on AD-associated gene data set (AlzGene) and
gene-gene interaction dataset (GIANT). Table 1 shows
the gene factors discovered by AI model.

CAD systems of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease
environmental is an additional AD risk factor that
possibly includes air pollution, inorganic and organic
hazards, brain trauma, industrial chemicals (Ô¨Çame
retardants), low education levels, lifestyle (exercise,
smoking, alcohol consumption), and exposure to heavy
metal (manganese, aluminum)[41‚Äì44]; where metals,
pesticides, and nanoparticles have been shown to
increase the risk of developing AD by alternating on
tau phosphorylation and (or) aggregation[45]. Among
these risk factors, it is estimated that approximately
60%‚Äì70% of the risk is contributed by genetic factors
for AD cases[46‚Äì48]. Most EOAD is inherited in an
autosomal dominant pattern, and research showed that
the development of AD is strongly associated with
mutations of dominant genes, such as apolipoprotein
E gene (APOE), Presenilin-1 (PSEN-1), Presenilin-2
(PSEN-2), and Amyloid precursor protein (APP)[49, 50].
In other AD-related genes, several single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in estrogen receptor (ER) and
ER have been shown to increase the risk of AD in
women because they may inÔ¨Çuence exogenous estrogen
in older women and affect cognitive aging. STX5 may
increase the risk of AD by investigating AD and other
types of dementias[51]. VCP has a positive relationship
with AD risk[52]. Researching the proteomics in
the AD brain found that the ALDOC is related to
AD[53]. HLA-B is regarded as a signal of patients with
hypersensitivity syndrome and has high speciÔ¨Åcity as
well as sensitivity assessment values; one research
found that the frequency of HLA-B signiÔ¨Åcantly differs
between normal and AD[54, 55].
IL10RB is one of
the cell signaling molecules for an aging disease in
young people. It is demonstrated as one of the best
discriminators to distinguish between normal and AD
individuals[56]. DDX19A has been proved to be an AD-
related gene by transcriptome-wide association study
(TWAS) and imaging-wide association study (IWAS)[57].
The miR-335-5p is one of the miRAN which is regarded
as an upregulated biomarker of AD[58].
In recent
decades, deep investigation of a molecular mechanism
using AI approaches has become more popular to
Ô¨Ånd etiology and risk factors for complex disease
understanding, such as cancer and AD. Most AI-based
etiology discovery methods detect disease risk factors
by evaluating the effectiveness of different factors
in the automatic diagnosis model. Sharma et al.[59]
In recent years, machine learning methods have been
widely used in studies of differential diagnosis of AD
based on neuroimaging, linguistic and genetic data. The
learning process of the AI-aid differential diagnosis
system mainly consists of three steps, as shown in
Fig. 3: (1) Input data; a CAD system for AD usually
uses speech, image, text or multi-modality. (2) Kim et
al.[63] deÔ¨Åned feature extraction as commonly adopted
to mean the construction of linear combinations of
continuous features with good discriminatory ability
between categories. For example, the gray level co-
occurrence matrix features are generally utilized for
image classiÔ¨Åcation. (3) ClassiÔ¨Åcation includes two
stages of training and test. The collected data is used to
utilized an ensemble of RF. They regularized regression
to build a diagnostic model to discover new genetic
factors of AD from different brain regions, including

all impairment levels. The different modalities of images
focus on different examinations[64‚Äì67]. fMRI and PET
are functional molecular imaging modalities, and they
are used to evaluate functional changes in brain function.
On the other hand, MRI and Diffusion Tensor Imaging
(DTI) are adopted to assess brain morphometry and the

used to classify new cases. The widely used classiÔ¨Åers
contain SVM, RF, and softmax.
We investigated 100 publications on CAD systems
for AD, and 66% of articles adopted neuroimaging data,
10% adopted linguistic data, 5% adopted gene data, and
19% adopted multi-modality data for diagnostic model
construction, as shown in Fig. 4.
3.2.1
Neuroimaging-based CAD systems
proposed a conventional machine learning-based model,
which consists of six steps for automatic diagnosis and
monitoring of the progression of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease
using fMRI imaging. The experiments were conducted
on the fMRI data from Dartmouth College. The results
show that the proposed model achieved 94% accuracy
for two class problems (classiÔ¨Åcation between healthy
elderly subjects and demented elderly subjects), 97%
accuracy for three class problems (classiÔ¨Åcation among
healthy elderly subjects, demented elderly subjects
with very mild AD, and demented elderly subjects
with mild AD), and 98.78% for four class problems
(classiÔ¨Åcation among healthy young subjects, healthy
elderly subjects, demented elderly subjects with very
mild AD, and demented elderly subjects with mild AD).
To address a single classiÔ¨Åer is hard to obtain a high
classiÔ¨Åcation performance on the 11C-PIB PET imaging
(the accuracy usually ranges from 60%‚Äì88%) because
the size of functional brain image PET is relatively
small and the amount of noise contained in it. The
work[69] combines three different classiÔ¨Åers (K-Nearest
Neighbors, Random Forests, and Neural Nets) by
weighted and unweighted schemes to discriminate AD,
MCI, and Control Normals (CN) on the PET dataset.
The unweighted method achieved results with an
accuracy of 84.3%, 75.2%, and 88.6% for AD, MCI
and CN, respectively. The weighted method gets 89%,
75%, and 84% in terms of accuracy for AD, MCI
and CN, respectively. In recent years, deep learning

in the Table 2. The surface area, volume, and cortical
thickness[73] are extracted through Freesurfer to detect
the region of interest (ROI), such as cortical thickness,
volume, and surface area, of MRI. The work[78]
generates 93 ROIs by computing the total intracranial
volume for each subject. The energy, entropy and gray
level co-occurrence matrix features (GLCM) are most
commonly adopted for image analysis. The work[68]
approaches demonstrated promising prediction results in
AD[70]. A CAD system differentiates two non-invasive
structural MRIs with different periods. The work
produces a jacobian volume to recognize the regions
of interest between MCI subjects and AD subjects
by voxel-based morphometric analysis. Then the
CNN-SVM classiÔ¨Åer is used to extract features of their
regions for AD prognosis prediction[71]. Experimental
results show an accuracy of 87.2%, sensitivity of
92.4%, and speciÔ¨Åcity of 80.4%. Similarly, Lei et al.[72]
extracts entropy, energy, and 13 Haralick texture features
by texture analysis, where the Ô¨Årst two features are
computed from multiwavelet transformation, and the
Haralick texture features are computed utilizing 64
GLCM in 8 directions. Some studies combine patient
information, such as gender, age, and medical history, to
enhance the performance of CAD systems[67, 71, 77]. The
temporal dependencies among features play an essential
role in AD prediction. A 3D Jacobian determinant
volume of longitudinal changes of each subject is
calculated to recognize the differences between the
baseline and the 12-month follow-up[71]. Considering all
features for AD classiÔ¨Åcation might cause noise because
most features are redundant. Selecting compelling
features is vital to generate an optimum classiÔ¨Åcation
performance. Lei et al.[78] utilized a joint learning
model for feature selection where the high dimension of
MRI features are reduced by the regularization method

proposed a multi-scale CNN model which introduces
channel attention to learn the dependency relation
between two channels and assign corresponding weight
value for each channel to extract multi-scale features
for AD diagnosis. The results show an accuracy of
97.91% for AD/NC, 94.44% for AD/MCI, and 90.74%
for MCI/NC. Hong et al.[73] employ multimodality
images, longitudinal MRI, PET and DTI, to develop an
LSTM-based network for AD progression prediction. In
another work, the proposed model achieves an AUC
of 93.5% for AD vs. NC, 79.8% for AD vs. MCI, and
77.7% for AD vs. NC vs. MCI. The tau deposition
in the human brain is an essential biomarker for AD
diagnosis[74, 75]. Jo et al.[76] utilized tau deposition
in tau PET images and developed a 3D CNN-based
network to separate AD from CN; the experiments
conducted on Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the result shows an accuracy
of 90.4% based on 5-fold cross-validation. To obtain
complementary information from different measures,
a deep ensemble learning model (DELearning) is
proposed to predict AD using multi-modality data
(including neuropathology, clinical evaluations, and
brain MRI imaging) from National Alzheimer‚Äôs
Coordinating Center (NACC) database. This work
focuses on the two outcomes prediction: AD and NC,
Through comparing DELearning and six ensemble
learning models (LogitBoost, AdaBoostM1, Vote,
RF, Bagging, Staking), the DELearning outperforms
baselines in terms of precision, recall, F1 score, and
accuracy[77]. Lei et al.[78] incorporated MRI data
and various clinical scores at multiple time points to
build longitudinal scores prediction framework. The
Alzheimer‚Äôs disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
experiments show that the proposed method outperforms
baselines and effectively reveals the relationship
between MRI data and clinical scores.
Neuroimaging data have been utilized to recognize
structural and functional biomarkers of AD, as shown

LASSO, and the non-Gaussian noise and impulsive noise
are removed through correntropy. The experimental
results show that it is the most inÔ¨Çuential parameter
among selected features. Lei et al.[72] introduced a
channel attention mechanism to learn global and local
ROI features and assign a higher weight coefÔ¨Åcient for
essential features. Finally, the features are fed into a
classiÔ¨Åer for classiÔ¨Åcation or prediction. The widely
used classiÔ¨Åer includes SVM, RF, KNN, etc.
3.2.2
Linguistics based CAD systems
Several studies attempted to utilize linguistic data to
distinguish AD patients with different impairment levels
from non-AD subjects‚Äîthe modalities of linguistic data
including audio, text or both. Alkenani Ahmed et al.[79]
took advantage of several based learning methods. They
developed multiple heterogeneous stacked fusion models
using written and spoken languages to enhance the
robustness and generalizability of the AD diagnostic
model. The feature space uses two linguistic patterns,
character n-gram and lexico syntactic sare. These
stacked fusion models obtain an AUC of 98.1% and
an F1 score of around 95% on the spoken-based
dataset. The AUC of 99.47% and the F1 score of
97% on the written-based datasets. By taking fully
connected positive features (diagnosis, procedures and
lab values) in electronic health records as the input
graph, the Graph Attention Network (GAT) serves as
the attention-based feature aggregator for generating
the representative node embeddings to be used for
predicting AD[16]. The deep-deep neural networks
language models (D2NNLM) are explored[80], utilizing
higher order n-grams to learn the linguistic changes to
recognize MCI and AD-type dementia from NC. The
results show D2NNLM statistically signiÔ¨Åcant AUC
on the clinical Pitt Corpus. Fraser et al.[81] adopted
topic models trained on word embeddings to extract
information units in monolingual and multilingual
spaces and combined supervised and unsupervised
learning methods to recognize MCI from healthy older
adults in English and Swedish. Results show that the
multilingual method improves classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy
over the one-language approach. Besides utilizing text
data, some works combine audio Ô¨Åles and related
automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcriptions to
improve language comprehension. Fraser et al.[82]
extracted 370 features from text and audio data to derive
a wide range of linguistic phenomena and adopt a
multilinear logistic regression model to classify AD and
NC. The results achieve the best accuracy, 81.92% when
using the top-35 features-motivated by the success of
deep neural networks language models on medical neural
language tasks. Luz et al.[83] classiÔ¨Åed AD and non-AD
through extracting a set of acoustic features and using a
classiÔ¨Åer of linear discriminant analysis (LDA), decision
trees (DT), nearest neighbor (1NN), RF, and SVM on
spontaneous speech data from ADReSS challenge, the
best result is obtained from RF model with an accuracy
of 62.5%. To better understand semantic information,
Edwards et al.[84] extracted features in the text at both
the phoneme and word level, and combine them with
the acoustic features to train a new multi-modal and
multi-scale model for AD identiÔ¨Åcation. The best result
is obtained by the combination of word and phoneme
representations. Sadeghian et al.[85] extracted features
using a deep learning model to reduce the complexity
of feature engineering of conventional machine learning
methods. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, it combines linguistic features
from an automatically determined transcription of the
speech (including punctuation) and acoustic features of
speech to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classiÔ¨Åer
to discriminate between AD and NC. In the experiments,
the accuracy is 94%. The lack of large data set poses
a challenge for the deep learning model. Thus, they
proposed the transfer learning base approach for AD
prediction from targeted speech[86]. The models are pre-
trained on a large dataset to learn word representations
and Ô¨Åne-tuned on the target dataset for the classiÔ¨Åcation
task, which means the features in this work are learned
in an unsupervised way, and the best result is obtained by
the combination of pre-trained deep transformer-based
models and LR classiÔ¨Åer. This paper mainly investigates
studies for linguistic-based AD prediction in the English
domain. Besides English, there are a lot of researches
adopting data in a variety of language domains, such
as Swedish[81, 87], French[88, 89], and Spanish[90, 91], but
a little in Chinese, the reason could be lack of public
text and speech dataset. Developing the AD diagnosis
systems for early screening in Chinese is essential.
For the linguistic data-based AD diagnostic model,
the features are mainly divided into acoustic and
text-based features[92], as shown in the Table 3. The
prosodic temporal features of the Acoustic feature are
most commonly used in the research, followed by the
pause pattern, which is an ASP-related feature. The
text-based feature consists of word embeddings and
lexical and syntactical features (i.e., n-gram, TTR,
TTC, syntactic complexity). The n-gram is the sequence
of characters or words with length n, which can be

are widely used acoustic features, speciÔ¨Åcally pause
patterns. The spectral features are the frequency domain
representation of the speech signal derived by Fourier
transform, such as mel-frequency cepstral coefÔ¨Åcients
(MFCC). Some works[83, 84] adopted the standardized
acoustic feature set, such as emobase, ComParE, MRCG,
and eGeMAPS. The detail of these feature sets is
introduced in the following. The emobase[93] feature
set includes voice quality features, MFCC, line spectral
pairs (LSP), intensity features, fundamental frequency
F0, and F0 envelopes.
ComParE[94] feature set contains MFCC, energy,
voicing related low-level descriptors (LLDs), and
spectrum. The LLDs consist of psychoacoustic spectral
sharpness, voice quality, logarithmic harmonic-to-noise
ratio, spectral harmonicity, and Viterbi smoothing for F0.
The total number of features is 6373.
eGeMAPS[95] feature set includes the alpha ratio,
F0 semitone, F1, F2, F3, MFCC, shimmer loudness,
slope V0 features, jitter, spectral Ô¨Çux, and Hammarberg
index. Note that the research in Ref. [50] reported the
gender difference could be reduced by using semitones
to express F0.
MRCG[96] utilizes time-frequency representation
to encode the audio signal‚Äôs multi-resolution power
distribution. The multi-resolution contains one high-
resolution level and three low-resolution levels. The
local information is encoded through a high-resolution
level, and the remaining three low resolutions extract
the spectro-temporal information. The total number of
6912 features is generated using the statistical function
on the 768 MRCG features. Besides the above acoustic
feature set, the minimal feature set used in Ref. [83],
consists of the basic statistics of pause, a vocalization
count, the duration of vocalizations and the speech rate.
This standardized feature set is effective in increasing
the reliability of the speech-based diagnosis model.
Still, the results in the studies[97‚Äì99] corroborated that
a combination of text and acoustic features can further
improve the performance of AD classiÔ¨Åcation.
consecutive or overlapping. The Type-Token Ratio
(TTR) and Type-token count (TTC) is adopted to
measure lexical complexity. TTR is the total number
of unique words (i.e., tokens) to the total number of
words in a given instance, and TTC is the total number of
unique words[79]. In addition, the idea density and word,
character, stop word and sentences account are extracted
as features for AD recognition in Ref.
[79], where
idea density is used to calculate the number of ideas
described in a given sentence. The idea means full use of
complex propositions and new information. The work[82]

Gene based CAD systems
The development of high-throughput omics has helped
us understand disease mechanisms at a detailed
molecular level. Thus far, a lot of work uses omics data
and AI algorithms to develop various diagnosis models
to identify the risk factors of complex diseases[7]. Wei et
al.[100] proposed a model-averaged NB model to predict
LOAD individuals with 312 to 318 SNPs from 1411
computes syntactic complexity by the clauses, the mean
length of sentences and T-units.
In addition, some
works[80, 81, 84, 86] use deep learning models, i.e., CBOW,
Glove, Sen2vec, and pre-trained language model, i.e.,
BERT, to automatically learn features (i.e., word and
sentence embeddings) from text and showed that they
are beneÔ¨Åcial for the AD prediction task. The prosodic

developed an SVM model for analyzing gene-encoded
protein sequence data that reached an accuracy of 85.7%
by testing 279 AD-associated protein sequence data and
1463 non-AD-associated protein sequence data in the
UniProt database.
Javier et al.[102] conducted comparisons of classical
machine learning approaches, including Bootstrap Stage-
Wise Model Selection (BSWiMS), Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), RF,
Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees (RPART),
KNN, mRMR, and ensemble of above approaches to
predict late-onset AD by using genetic variation data
from ADNI cohort. The result shows that the ensemble
of all machine learning methods achieved the best
performance with an ROC AUC of 71.9%. Park et al.[103]
developed a deep-learning approach for AD prediction
using multiple heterogeneous omics datasets. The result
obtained an accuracy of 82.3% by integrating gene
expression and DNA methylation data. Some studies
adopted blood-based expression data to predict AD,
early AD or uncover key genes associated with AD
because it is hard to obtain an omics dataset from brain
issues of AD subjects. Lee et al.[30] adopted Ô¨Åve feature
selection approaches and Ô¨Åve classiÔ¨Åers, including LR,
L1-GLM, RF, SVM and DNN, to discriminate against
AD individuals; the results obtain 65.7%, 87.4%, and
80.4% AUC values for ADNI, ANM1 and ANM2
datasets in internal validation.
The above studies show that using machine learning
approaches to predict and diagnose AD by analysis of
genetic data. But if incorporated with other modal data,
such as text, audio, and image, the accuracy of the
predicted model can be signiÔ¨Åcantly improved.

Multimodal data based CAD systems
machine learning model, along with fusion model
on NACC and OASIS datasets, the results show that
the MRI-only model yielded AUC of 84.4% (NACC)
and 84.6% (OASIS) for COGNC (NC/MCI and DE)
task, AUC of 86.9% (NACC) and 85.8% (OASIS) for
COGDE (DE/NC and MCI) task, AUC value of 73.4%
(NACC) and 69.4% (OASIS) for ADD (AD/nADD)
task. Non-imaging model obtained an AUC of 93.6%
(NACC) and 95.9% (OASIS) for the COGNC task, AUC
of 96.2% (NACC) and 97.1% (OASIS) for COGDE
task, AUC of 74.9% (NACC) and 68.9% (OASIS) for
ADD task. The fusion model yielded an AUC of 94.5%
(NACC) and 95.9% (OASIS) for the COGNC task, AUC
of 97.1% (NACC) and 97.1% (OASIS) for COGDE
task, AUC of 77.3% and 77.3% for ADD task. From the
comparing results, we can Ô¨Ånd that fusion of modalities
performs better than both MRI-only and non-imaging
models.
Golovanevsky et al.[37] combined neural networks
and attention to present a multimodal AD diagnosis
framework (MADDi) to classify NC, AD, and MCI
using imaging, genetic, and clinical data. By evaluating
the contributions of each modality on overlap patient
set, the results show that the model achieved an
accuracy of 82.29%, 77.78%, 71.66%, 92.5%, 78.33%,
85.83%, and 96.88% for the adoption of clinical data,
genetic data, imaging data, clinical and genetic data,
genetic and imaging data, imaging and clinical data, all
above modalities, respectively. It demonstrated that a
combination of three modalities could further improve
the AD diagnosis model. Lin et al.[108] utilized a linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) scoring approach to fusing
multi-modality data, including MRI, PET, CSF, and
genetic features, to classify AD, MCI, and NC. To
evaluate the contribution of each modality, the model
obtained an accuracy of 61.5% for only MRI, 56.3%
for only PET, 55% for only CSF, 62.5% for without
MRI, 65.5% for without PET, 63.9% for without CSF,
66.3% for without gene, and 66.7% for the fusion of
different modalities on the three-way diagnosis. The
results show that the MRI has the most signiÔ¨Åcant effect
on the model performance, followed by CSF and PET.
The performance increased by 0.5% when considering
genetic features because the genetic feature is the minor
data.
Chen et al.[109] developed a deep learning-based
model to classify NC, MCI, and AD by fusing multi-
modality data, such as MRI, MRI text reports, mental
and psychological test results, and few-shot learning.
Recently,
most
works
integrate
molecular
and
phenotypic data, such as MRI and neuropsychological
tests, for AD prediction. Compared to individual modal
data, the medical data from different modalities can
provide more complementary medical information to
each other about the disease condition of patients[104‚Äì106].
Therefore, the effective adoption of multi-modality
data is crucial for reliable clinical disease diagnosis.
Qiu et al.[107]
employed multi-modality data of
MRI, clinical information, as well as functional and
neuropsychological assessments to develop a deep
learning-based model for AD, NC, MCI, and nADD
(non-AD dementias) classiÔ¨Åcation. By comparing
the MRI-only CNN model, non-imaging traditional

SVM and 10-fold cross-validation. To better preserve
the integrity of intra-modality, Zhang et al.[114] utilized
multiple kernel learning (MKL) to encapsulate features
of each modality by themselves for the prediction of
sMCI and pMCI in 18 months. This model achieved an
accuracy of 76.4% on the ADNI dataset. Cheng et al.[115]
In the comparative experiments conducted on a dataset
from a third-class hospital in Shanghai, the model
obtained an accuracy of 59.2% for only structured
reports, 52.8% for only text reports, 47.6 for only MRI,
66.8% for the fusion of multi-modalities, as well as
79.6% for the combination of multi-modalities and few-
shot learning. It has been proved that multi-modality
data fusion can improve classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy. The
details can be seen in Table 4. For multi-modal feature
selection, Spooner et al.[110] developed a model to
recognize AD-relevant biomarkers by feature selector
automatically. In the experiments conducted on the
Sydney Memory and Aging Study and ADNI datasets,
the identiÔ¨Åed AD biomarker included that the APOE
gene, abnormal gait, tau, phosphorylated tau and
amyloid-(A42). In addition, inÔ¨Çammation, depression
and low-level education are thought to play an essential
role in the pathophysiology of AD. Using the SVM
model, Kate et al.[111] discovered AD multi-modal
biomarkers from 810 subjects, including normal, MCI,
and AD. The results show that APOE genotype, age,
neuropsychological memory score, hippocampus and
amygdala are signiÔ¨Åcant biomarkers to distinguish
between normal and MCI. Comparing amyloid-positive
CN individuals and amyloid-positive MCI individuals,
the latter had lower bilateral hippocampal and amygdala
volumes,
along with lower whole brain average
cortical thickness. The study[112] highlighted the
longitudinal multi-modal structure MRI as a prognostic
and diagnostic biomarker that has potential value
for presymptomatic to early symptomatic familial
frontotemporal dementia.

predicted MCI conversion to leverage MCI subjects‚Äô
information with NC and AD as auxiliary domains,
and developed a domain transfer learning model on
the ADNI dataset, containing 51 AD subjects, 99 MCI
subjects, and 52 NC subjects. This model obtained an
accuracy of 79.4%, outperforming the methods without
utilizing information from the auxiliary domain.
In machine learning-based AD diagnosis, adequate
label data for prediction tasks is hard to obtain since
manual labeling is time-consuming and labor-intensive.
Yuan et al.[116] proposed a semi-supervised model to
classify sMCI and pMCI in 3 years. It Ô¨Årst extracted
quantitative trail (QT) from 228 labeled structural MRI
and SNP features from genotype data to construct two
initial classiÔ¨Åers. Then, the 136 unlabeled structural
MRI samples are automatically annotated through a
co-learning strategy; Ô¨Ånally, the RF is used to train a
combined classiÔ¨Åer to classify MCI patients from the
ADNI-2 dataset. Results show an accuracy of 85.5%.
In a recent study, deep learning gained popularity in
predicting disease progression. Lin et al.[117] designed
a deep learning method based on CNN to predict MCI
to AD conversions using MRI data within three years.
This study gets an accuracy of 79.9%. Tabarestani et
al.[118] utilized Cerebrospinal Ô¨Çuid (CSF), MRI, PET
cognitive test scores demographic with genetic, and
two variations of the RNN model, i.e., long short-term
memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units for prediction
of the patient status of following three-time points by the
previous three historical time points. The results show
that the predictive performance of LSTM and GRU are
signiÔ¨Åcantly improved by incorporating the L1 feature,
and the accuracy of LSTM based model is higher than
GRU based model. Some works built a model for both
classiÔ¨Åcation and prognosis tasks. Beheshti et al.[119]
A prognosis that concerns quantiÔ¨Åcation of disease
progressions is equally signiÔ¨Åcant to diagnosis, such
as prediction of the disease progression in a time frame
or assessment of the time to dementia onset. Existing
AD prognostic studies mainly focus on predicting MCI
to AD. We summarize some representative studies
in Table 5. In earlier times, Ritter et al.[113] used
SVM, classiÔ¨Åcation tree, and RF to extract features
from neuropsychological testing, MRI, FDG-PET,
CSF, medical history, demographic information, and
neurological and physical examinations into a combined
feature set for the prediction of sMCI (stable MCI) and
pMCI (progressive MCI) within three years. The best
performance is with maximal accuracy of 73% by using
developed a new model that utilizes a genetic approach
and feature ranking to analyze sMRI data to classify
NC with AD and predict the conversion of pMCI with
sMCI three years before clinical diagnosis. The results
researchedan accuracy of 93.01% for classiÔ¨Åcation and
75% for pMCI as well as sMCI prediction. Zheng et

dataset, and 89.77% for NC/ASD (Autism Spectrum
Disorder) on ABIDE dataset. Yubraj et al.[121] developed
a machine learning-based model to classify and predict
AD by combining four biomarkers, such as FDG-PET,
sMRI, CFS, and AOPE. The results reached an accuracy
of 98.33% for AD/NC, 93.59% for sMCI/pMCI, 96.83%
for AD/sMCI, 94.64% for AD/pMCI, 96.43% for
NC/pMCI, and 95.24% for NC/sMCI.

AI-aid treatment of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease
Treatment in AD subjects aims to alleviate and possibly
improve cognition loss along with maintain autonomous
function. The treatment of AD mainly includes
pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches.
Currently, AD drugs can only alleviate symptoms rather
than reverse the progress of the disease[122, 123]. It
is essential to keep searching for therapeutic drugs,
moreover, machine learning provides a promising way
for drug discovery. Fang et al.[124] applied recursive
partitioning and a naive Bayesian algorithm to build a
classiÔ¨Åer for predicting chemical-protein interactions
of AD using the multitarget-quantitative structure-
activity relationships (mt-QSAR) approach. They utilize
validated models to systematically predict the potential
targets from 25 key AD targets for six approved anti-AD
drugs and 19 known active compounds associated with
AD. Repurposing drugs for AD has recently received
much attentions[125]. Rodriguez et al.[126] developed a
Drug Repurposing In AD (DRIAD) framework using
machine learning algorithms, including LR, SVM, RF,
and two-layer fully connected NN, to quantify potential
relationships between the pathology of AD severity and
molecular mechanisms. DRIAD tested 80 compounds,
where 33 were FDA-approved and might be directly used
for repurposing; the remaining 33 preclinical compounds
and 14 investigational compounds, which DRIAD highly
scored, can provide a reference for FDA-approved
compounds selection. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
are one of the signiÔ¨Åcant reasons for the failure of drugs.
Thus, an effective predictive model of ADRs is essential.
Jamal et al.[127] used a relief-based feature selection
method to recognize relevant properties and employed a
machine learning model to predict neurological ADRs
before preclinical testing. They predicted ADRs for
existing anti-AD drugs and uncharacterized drugs on
the side effect resource (SIDER) dataset. The model
obtains an accuracy of 93.2% for chemical, 92.41% for
phenotypic, 94.18% for integration of three properties,
and 82.11% for biological properties.
Besides pharmacological approaches, more scientists
26
Tsinghua Science and Technology, February 2024, 29(1): 13‚Äì33
have integrated personalized and adaptive elements to
design a cognitive training game. Some studies design
adaptive games by dynamically changing the parameters
of
games
and
generating
new
content[17, 128‚Äì130].
Relevant studies showed that adaptive electronic science
games could match the different levels of players with
the different difÔ¨Åculties of games so that games can
improve cognitive ability[12, 131‚Äì133], which provides an
important reference for AD treatment. As mentioned
above, there are still no drugs that can cure or
effectively reverse AD. Thus, AI-based AD treatment
research mainly focuses on mining the relations between
chemicals and proteins.

Public AD Dataset
study designed to promote research into key factors of
health and disease, mainly in middle-aged and older
adults[142]. The participants have generously provided
a wealth of information on the environment, lifestyle,
socio-demographic, health and well-being, as well as
a range of cognitive and physical tests since 2006. To
date, the UKB has approved projects studying dementia
and cognitive impairment, such as high risk factors
for dementia, whole-neuroimaging and genome-wide
association studies, along with diagnostic models[143].
Pitt corpus consists of picture descriptions derived by
Cookie Theft Picture collected by the University of
Pittsburgh[144] and distributed by DementiaBank[145, 146].
The Cookie Theft Picture is produced through AD
patients and healthy participants and related to their
neuropsychological data. It is worth noting that the
existing public AD-related linguistic datasets are
still limited in the Chinese domain. The Alzheime‚Äôs
Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP)[147] is part of
the NIA Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Genetics Portfolio and
contains more than 350 investigators worldwide. ADSP
contains multiple genes and accompanying phenotypic
information, such as age, gender, and cognitive
measures.

Perspective for the Future
With the development of data sharing sources and
adoption of AI technologies for etiology discovery,
diagnosis, prognosis as well as treatment of disease,
the novel technologies and medical service system will
be introduced to address the public healthcare demand
for high quality human-centered operation of emergency
care, as shown in Fig. 5.

dementia
As mentioned above, most existing diagnostic models

Data collection is fundamental to building a machine
learning model for AD applications. The open
established datasets are selected in most studies to add
research value. The Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) database[134, 135] is one of the most
popular datasets for AD prediction, and was established
in 2003. The study of ADNI takes about 17 years
and consists of 4 phases: ADNI-1 (5 years), ADNI-
GO (2 years), ADNI-2 (5 years), and ADNI-3 (5
years). It contains multiple data types, including
brain imaging data, such as MRI, PET, clinical data,
biospecimen, and genetic data. The category of AD
stages in ADNI includes AD, MCI, NC, etc. In
addition, ADNI will continue to track and update
the database of the pre-diagnosed population. The
National Alzheime‚Äôs Coordinating Center (NACC)
database[136, 137] maintained a cumulative database
and was founded in 1999. It includes more than
45 000 participants and different types of clinical
data, such as neuropathology, clinical evaluations,
and brain MRI imaging. In the linguistic domain,
DementiaBank is a primary public dataset to evaluate
the spoken language of the AD patient. It collected
45‚Äì90 years old English-speaking participants from
1983 to 1988. The OASIS (Open Access Series of
Imaging Studies) database[138, 139] consists of four
versions of data sets. OASIS-1 and OASIS-2 are
cross-sectional and longitudinal MRI data. OASIS-3
is a longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging, clinical
biomarker, and cognitive dataset collected from 1378
normally aging with AD members. OASIS-4 included
clinical, biomarker, MRI, and cognitive data from
patients presenting with memory complaints. The UK
Biobank (UKB)[140, 141] is a large-scale prospective

(4) Constructing a reliable and high quality CAD
or CAP system
Although a lot of powerful ML based models have
been presented to solve real-world medical problems
and have obtained the remarkable performance when
many samples existed, their clinical application is limited
without the trust of human experts[149]. Understanding
the reasons of a decision made by ML model is a
prerequisite of next medical decision. For the future
ML applications, the human-in-the-loop is a solution to
enhance ML performance and receive reliable results in
medical applications by collaboration of humans and
ML approaches. First, in the building time, medical
experts can provide prior knowledge in the different
stages of model building, i.e. data producing, pre-
processing, feature selection and training stages, to
help for producing high quality training samples and
improving the performance of the ML prediction.
Second, in the running time, providing an interface of
Human-AI interaction enable medical experts as the
users of ML models to validate and reÔ¨Åne models and
obtain the acceptable outputs. It provides great potentials
to improve not only the performance of ML models but
also the interpretability of the clinical decision.

Conclusion
This article reviews recent research on AI (machine
learning)
based
solutions
on
etiology
discovery,
automatic diagnosis, prognosis and treatment for AD
using different modalities. The multi-modality data
includes neuroimaging, linguistic, genetic and multi-
modality data to help new researchers to build a
comprehensive understanding of AI technology applied
in AD research. Emerging AI technologies offer
possibilities in the medical domain but also bring
challenges. AI-based models can assist radiologists,
neurosurgeons and other medical staff with better clinical
decision-making and analyze the relationship between
complex factors for etiology discovery and aid treatment
of AD. Although certain limitations exist, we believe
that with the continuous improvement of data sharing
resources and computational creativity, a comprehensive
and integral analysis system can be established soon to
help AD research.
Acknowledgment
This work was partially supported by the National
Key R&D Program of China (No. 2020YFB2104402)
recognize AD patients, mainly focusing on MCI and
the dementia stage. To reduce the substantial burden
on patients, carers, and society and increase the
quality of healthcare, it is essential to shift focus to
recognizing individuals in the preclinical stage. By early
intervention, lifestyle changes can be delayed, reducing
healthcare costs and preventing further progression.
With the treatment option for AD being limited, the key
transformation of AD is focused on prevention rather
than treatment. The United States Congressional Budget
OfÔ¨Åce has noticed that preventive care is a key innovation
for healthcare[148]. However, previous research showed
that AD prevention is hard to implement, because
of lacking healthcare resources. The new solutions
facilitate practical preventive care by engaging patients
in preventing disease, utilizing interactive, patient-
oriented techniques based on health information systems.
(2) High-quality data sharing resource
The quality of the health data resources is fundamental
for obtaining correct results. Large-scale and diversiÔ¨Åed
data resources can reÔ¨Çect the real distribution of data and
improve the ability of researchers to spot important and
weak factors. However, as mentioned above, most of the
real-world AD datasets are private, so it cannot conduct
a comparative study of these researches with future
work. Moreover, the widely used public dataset, such
as ADNI, comes from developed countries and does not
contain signiÔ¨Åcant populations in developing countries.
For linguistic-based AD research, current CAD systems
are mainly based on English, rarely in Chinese. The
promising solution is to develop and improve the data-
sharing resource by promoting cooperation between
national and international medical institutions.
(3) ‚ÄúCustomer-centered‚Äù medical service system
A critical characteristic of the transformation driven
by AI technology in healthcare is replacing the
‚Äúpatient-centered‚Äù medical service system with a
‚Äúcustomer-centered‚Äù medical service system. It aims
to improve patient satisfaction by boosting the quality
of healthcare services and encouraging individuals
to assume responsibility for their health. On the
other hand, with the development of information
technology, it is believed that intelligent and partially
autonomous local implementations can support end-user
self-determination; at the same time, telemonitoring and
telecare are supported by the development of wearable
devices as well as smartphone applications. These
devices will also collect the data resources.
