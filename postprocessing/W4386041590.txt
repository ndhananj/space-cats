Lesson Learned from COVID-19 Retrospective Study:
An Entropy-Based Clinical-Interpretable Scorecard for
Mortality Risk Control at ICU Admission
Chong Yao, Chonghui Huangqi, and Anpeng Huang
Abstract: With severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spreading globally and causing 2019 coronavirus
disease (COVID-19), a challenge that we unprepared for was about how to optimally plan and distribute limited
top-medical resources for patients in need of urgent care. To address this challenge, physicians desperately needed
a scientiÔ¨Åc tool to methodically differentiate between cases with varying severity. In this study, the unique data
of COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients provided by the national medical team in Wuhan were classiÔ¨Åed
into discrete and continuous variable types. All continuous data were discretized using an entropy-based method
and transformed into serial information margins, in which each information margin is related to a speciÔ¨Åc symptom
or clinical meaning. Finally, all these native and processed discrete data were used to conÔ¨Ågure a readable
scorecard through logistic regression, which is the desired scientiÔ¨Åc tool aforementioned. A total of 322 ICU patients
(age: [median: 64, interquartile range: 54‚Äì75], males: 178 [55.28%], and death: 72 [22.36%]) were included in
the study. Probabilities of mortality in COVID-19 patients can be evaluated using a scorecard model (calibration
slope: 1.343, Brier: 0.048, Dxy = 0.972, and population stability index = 0.071), with desired model performances
(accuracy = 0.948, area under curve = 0.99, sensitivity = 1, and speciÔ¨Åcity = 0.939). This new model can interpret
clinical meanings from complex data, and compare it with existing machine learning methods through a black-box
mechanism. This new data-information model answers a critical question of how a computing algorithm produces
clinically meaningful results that will help physicians logically allocate medical resources for COVID-19 patients.
Notably, this tool has limitations, giving that this research is a retrospective study. Hopefully, this tool will be tested
further and optimized for adaptation to similar clinical cases in the future.

Introduction
Until November 27, 2022, more than 645 million
conÔ¨Årmed cases and over 6.6 million deaths worldwide
have been recorded. How to maximize the utilization of
intensive care unit (ICU) medical resources is a critical
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading
globally and is known as the ‚Äúkiller‚Äù of public health.

professionally and labeled by clinical experts. All
data processing personnel were required to sign a
data security and conÔ¨Ådentiality agreement to protect
patient-doctor conÔ¨Ådentiality. For the assessment of
this model‚Äôs effectiveness in different situations, two
more external cohorts were applied (one was from Yan
et al.[7] study: https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-
020-0180-7; the other was a Peru cohort: https://
Ô¨Ågshare.com/articles/dataset/Database.xls/13869179).

Data preprocessing
issue, especially in areas with medical shortages.
A related study will be useful for increasing the
efÔ¨Åciency of treatment and resource allocation. More
importantly, physicians need a tool to Ô¨Åght future
pandemics when ICU admissions increase exponentially,
thereby decreasing mortality rates. Driven by this
motivation,
a scientiÔ¨Åc tool is needed to help
physicians make objective judgments, rather than
subjective logical choices. This tool may include several
essential components, namely, data preprocessing,
computational methods, knowledge discovery, and
clinical interpretation. In terms of data preprocessing,
Selvan[1], Shang et al.[2], and Overmyer et al.[3]
discussed data formalization and cleaning. Regarding
survival analysis, related literature addressing logistic
models and machine learning algorithms for risk scoring
were examined by Zhang et al.[4], Tian et al.[5], and
Liang et al.[6]. As for knowledge discovery, clinical
information is extremely complex to be extracted in a
linear style according to Yan et al.[7], Gao et al.[8], and
Yadaw et al.[9]. Lastly, for clinical interpretation, the
black-box data-information model of machine learning
algorithms cannot be applied in clinical practice, as
discussed by Knight et al.[10] and Razavian et al.[11]
Therefore, this topic must be studied from a new
perspective to efÔ¨Åciently translate data knowledge into
clinical information. Taking this into consideration, we
developed an entropy-based scorecard model to achieve
clinical interpretability. This data-information model can
be used to categorize patients depending on case severity
with the use of a few key bioparameters. Arguably, this
model helps in assigning limited medical resources to
patients who possess a higher probability of survival and
aids physicians in maximizing ICU resources.

Method
2.1
Data resource
For data quality control, 322 cases from 345 ICU patients
were Ô¨Ånally selected as study subjects, with the omission
of 23 inconclusive data (i.e., 4 patients transferred out
and 19 non-tracking documents). On the Ô¨Årst day of
admission, information on each patient was collected
for clinical and blood biochemical samples, generating
49 separate categories of data entries. For the study of
validity and data integrality, an entry may be deleted
if its data distribution had low diversity, or more than
20% of patients lacked such an entry. As a result, 30
out of the 49 variables were selected as candidates and
treated as input variables of our data-information model.
To examine all potential dysfunction or bugs in our
models, we selected 97 individuals (30% of patients)
as the test data set, and the other 70% of subjects
were grouped into the training dataset to optimize the
model hyperparameters. The basic requirement was
that the test dataset had no voids, and some nulls in the
training dataset were Ô¨Ålled in advance for data continuity.
To avoid additional background noise in the process
of null Ô¨Ållings, we applied K-Nearest-Neighbours
(KNN) to enhance the resolution[12‚Äì15]. Furthermore,
data classiÔ¨Åcation processing methods were a part of
our models and machine learning algorithms, but they
likely relied on their statistical distribution features.
For different data, including demographic, clinical, and
blood biochemistry characteristics by survival status,
the mean (Standard Deviation (SD)) and student t-test
were applied to continuous variables following normal
distribution; the median (interquartile range (IQR)) and
Mann-Whitney U (U-test) were deployed if they did not
show a normal distribution. Otherwise, the variables
were considered categorical, frequency and chi-square
tests were adopted for their distribution proÔ¨Åle.
2.3
Model conÔ¨Åguration
In this study, the main goal was to conceive a new
data-informal model that can avoid the dilemma of
This study is a retrospective research. The ICU patient
cohort was from the national medical team in Wuhan and
contained data from January 26, 2020, to April 6, 2020;
the patients were conÔ¨Årmed by oropharyngeal swabs
and positive antigen-antibody tests. The data included
routine records at admission, comorbidities, and disease
severity, along with laboratory test results such as
nucleic acid tests, routine blood tests, biochemistry,
etc. Each patient‚Äôs information was recorded from
ICU admission to Ô¨Ånal discharge. All data from
patients‚Äô electronic medical records were formalized

justifying the allocation of resources to patients who
are more likely to survive. This dilemma decision
cannot be made blindly by a data model without clinical
explanation. Currently, most artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence data
models run in a ‚Äúblack-box‚Äù style, which cannot present
clinical explanations from computing results. To address
this challenge above, we conceived an entropy-based
scorecard model (Fig. 1) in this study and adopted
logistic regression to compute data. Each component of
this model is illuminated below.
2.3.1
Variable formalization
the placement of data zones. This entropy method
can avoid potential crosstalk-intermixing between data
zones[16].
The function of entropy is listed below:
H.X/ D  
X
p.k/  log p.k/
(1)
where X is an event (death or living), and H.X/ is
the entropy value of variable X with the kth data zone
within K discrete data zones. p.k/ is the probability of
the event X during the kth data zone.
After discretization based on entropy, the continuous
variable became the ordinal categorical data zone. To
code these ordinal data zones, we applied the weight
of evidence (WOE)[17, 18] to maintain logic linearity,
which can satisfy the logic linearity hypothesis in logistic
regression compared with other coding methods (one
hot spot/virtual). The WOE of the ith data zone of a
categorical variable is deÔ¨Åned as follows:
Ni.death/=Ntot.death/
(2)
WOEi D ln Ni.nondeath/=Ntot.nondeath/
Ni.nondeath/: the number of patients who survived within
the ith data zone of the selected categorical variable;
Ni.death/:
the number of deceased patients within
the ith data zone of the selected categorical variable;
Ntot.nondeath/: the total number of patients who survived;
Ntot.death/: the total number of deceased patients.
2.3.2
Variable selection
To evaluate the roles of each variable, we applied the
information values (IV) formula[17].

As discussed above, the Ô¨Årst goal was to determine
how to deal with mixed data with continuous and
discrete variables. For any continuous variable, a clinical
outcome is generally related to a range of data. For
example, the level of systolic pressure can be interpreted
as normal, hypertension, or hypotension among most
people (90‚Äì140, above 140, and below 90 mmHg,
respectively). Thus, these continuous variables need
to be discretized into a sequence of data zones to match
each one with a speciÔ¨Åc symptom or similar clinical
outcome. An optimal solution is needed to group these
continuous variables into a sequence of data zones.
In the optimal solution, how the cutoff endpoints of
these continuous variables can be determined for data
zones must be resolved. To address this problem, we
borrowed the entropy concept, which was originally
from physics, and has been successfully applied in
many areas, e.g., information theory, credit review
for Ô¨Ånancial loans, binning computing, etc. Entropy,
or the information content, is a way to calculate the
information gain of different data segment solutions. The
calculated information gain values was used to optimize

were ranked using backward stepwise regression in
accordance with the exact Akaike information criterion
(AIC). In general, variables with IV < 0:02[19] were not
considered in this model due to insigniÔ¨Åcant information
predictability.

Model evaluation
To evaluate the new model, we applied several key
performance metrics.
First, whether the results of this new model matched
real situations is signiÔ¨Åcant. Here, Brier scores and
calibration curves[20] were deployed to describe gaps
between the model and statistical facts. The values of
Brier scores were between 0 and 1, in which a smaller
value indicates a better performance.
Second, training and test data sets should have no bias.
The population stability index (PSI) is widely used to
measure bias; it is normalized between 0 and 1, in which
a small value indicates high stability. PSI is calculated
as follows:
d: the probability of mortality, : parameter vector
≈íW0; W1; : : : ; Wn¬ç, in which Wi is the ith variable
coefÔ¨Åcient, X: variable vector ≈í1; X1; : : : ; Xn¬ç, in which
Xi is the ith variable value.
To visualize and interpret this function for clinical
application, which is widely used in Ô¨Ånancial credits,
etc., we mapped its results to a scorecard. The scorecard
formulas are listed in Eqs. (4) to (12).
scoretotal D A C B  ln .odds/
(7)
A: intercept (the score points when probabilities of death
and survival are equal); B: slope (a margin while scoring
points against ln .odds/(changing); odds: probability
of death .d//survival probability .1   d/.
To normalize the outcome results of the scorecard,
we initialized the parameters as below. A speciÔ¨Åc point
score of P0 was set, with odds D odds0. The point-to-
double odds (PDO) refer to the difference when odds D
odds0 becomes odds D

19, and PDO D 50. Thus, the odds (death
probability/survival probability) of the patient at 600
score points was 1/19, and the value was reduced by half
for every 50 points lost (Fig. 2).
These initialization factors were brought back into the
following formula:
P0 D A C B  ln .odds0/

m: the number of groups, which are classiÔ¨Åed by a
metric of equal score zone in the training data set; li:
the patient proportion in the training data set when their
scores are in the ith group of m; qi: the patient proportion
in the test data set when their scores are in the ith group
of m, where PSI D 0; ideally, the patient proportions
in training and test data sets must be equal in each
group. Existing rules of thumb are as follows: PSI <
0:10 means ‚Äúlittle shift‚Äù, 0:10 < PSI < 0:25 means
‚Äúmoderate shift‚Äù, and PSI > 0:25 means ‚ÄúsigniÔ¨Åcant
shift, action required[21]‚Äù.
Third, this model is needed to evaluate how much gain
is valid. Here, a decision curve analysis[22] was applied
to calculate ‚ÄúNET BeneÔ¨Åts‚Äù, which were referred to, was

than that of the survival group (68 versus 63). Each of
these 72 deceased patients suffered from one or more
symptoms of consciousness disorder, whose probability
and seriousness levels were higher than those of the
survival group (24% versus 14%). Men accounted for
69.01%, which was higher than the 50.41% observed
in the survival group, as shown in Table 1. The
distribution of blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate
(RR), temperature, and blood biochemical indicators,
etc., deviated between samples of the deceased and
surviving patients (Table 2). The dead patients suffered
from higher RR, lower blood oxygen saturation, and
higher temperature, accompanied by increased levels
of leukocytes, neutrophils, high sensitive troponin-
I (hsTnl), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide
(NT-proBNP), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-
6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) procalcitonin, and decreased
levels of lymphocytes along with platelets.

Our proposal: Scorecard model for death risk
prediction
TPC: true positive count; FPC: false-positive count; t:
threshold probability of a given event.
Fourth, this model‚Äôs efÔ¨Åciency was compared with
those of typical machine learning algorithms in the same
test data set. Six machine learning algorithms were
applied: penalty logistic regression (logistic elastic),
KNN, support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient
boosting (XGBoost), random forests (RF), and a voting
model (RF + XGBoost). To prevent prepositive bias
from machine learning algorithms, we used the typical
adaptive synthetic[25] strategy to balance the probabilities
of both dead and survival samples in the training data
set. Their hyperparameters were optimized by combining
grid search and Ô¨Åvefold cross-validation.
Finally, the model was validated on the two other
external datasets (one was from Yan et al.[7] study:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-0180-7,
and the other was from a Peru cohort: https://Ô¨Ågshare.
com/articles/dataset/Database.xls/13869179).
Given that no same datasets had all identical variables,
we checked the kernel performance of this model in part.
Initially, we observed all common variables between
our dataset and two external datasets. Second, our model
was simpliÔ¨Åed by using these common variables as input,
exclusively. Logically, our model can work well if its
kernel performance is accepted in other different datasets
with only common variables. All tests were two-tailed,
and their results were statistically signiÔ¨Åcance when P-
value was less than 0.05. Python (3.9.1) was used for
machine learning algorithms, including numpy, pandas,
matplotlib, sklearn, imblearn, scipy, and XGBoost
packages along with R (version 4.0.2), involving Ô¨ÅnalÔ¨Åt,
glmnet, ggplot2, pROC, rmda, and tidyverse packages,
were applied for the scorecard.

Result
3.1
Patient statistic
As aforementioned, 30 out of 49 variables were selected
for this study (Table 3). Twelve items were excluded
due to the data incompleteness issue, along with seven
variables being deleted for the sake of low diversity.
Among the selected 30 variables from 322 patients,
two more items were removed as a consequence of
the high correlation of neutrophils (cor [neutrophils,
lymphocytes] D 0.92) and NT-proBNP (cor [TNI, NT-
proBNP] D 0.82). Thus, only 28 variables were deemed
suitable for the study.
To search for clinical meanings from these 28
study variables, we discretized the continuous variables
by tree-like segmentation. In accordance with the
clinical criteria, cutoff points were set based on their
entropy values and adjusted if necessary. After data
differentiation and entropy processing, 8 of the 28 items
were discarded because their IVs were less than 0.02.
The remaining 20 variables were explored by backward
stepwise variable selection in accordance with the AIC.
After the selection process, we observed that mortality
risks were more signiÔ¨Åcantly affected by eight factors:
namely age, temperature, RR, disease cluster, leukocyte,
lymphocytes, hsTnl, and IL-10. Their attributes are
listed below: age (odds ratio(OR): 5.68; 95% conÔ¨Ådence
interval (CI): 1.74‚Äì24.1), RR (OR: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.12‚Äì
5.59), temperature (OR: 2.88; 95% CI: 1.19‚Äì7.41), and
disease cluster (OR: 1.78; 95% CI: 0.87‚Äì3.93), leukocyte
(OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 0.90‚Äì2.77), lymphocytes (OR: 2.02;
The 322 patients included in this study had a median
(IQR) age of 64 (54‚Äì70.75) years old, and males
accounted for 55.28%. A total of 139 (46.49%) patients
had hypertension, 66 (22.54%) had diabetes, and 246
(88.17%) had symptoms of coughing. Among the 322
samples, 72 (22.4%) patients died, and their median
(IQR) age was 68 (60.0‚Äì74.74) years old, which is higher

As displayed in Fig. 3, the calibration curves matched
the desired requirements: slope D 1343, Brier D 0.048,
and Dxy D 0.972. In Fig. 4, the decision curves show
that the scorecard model satisÔ¨Åed clinical utility in the
test data set. In terms of computing effectiveness and
efÔ¨Åciency, six typical algorithms (e.g., KNN, logistic-
elastic, SVM, XGBoost, RF, and a voting model) were
cited as alternates. According to Table 4, the RF achieved
the best performance (ACC D 87.6%; AUC D 97.6%),
followed by XGBoost (ACC D 85.6%; AUC D 96.1%),
and logistic elastic (ACC D 86.6%; AUC D 94.7%).
Compared with these traditional machine learning
models, our entropy-based discretization scorecard
model achieved a better performance (ACC D 94.8%;
AUC D 98.6%).

reliable given the PSI D 0:071 between the training
and test datasets (Fig. 5). As shown in Table 6, when the
patient‚Äôs death risk score was lower than a threshold of
205, the mortality rate was close to 100% (training set:
96.2%; test set: 100%). When the scores were between
thresholds 205 to 459, the mortality rates decreased
signiÔ¨Åcantly, and when the score was higher than the
score at our threshold of 459, the mortality rate was
close to 0. In real scenarios, these score ranges can be
adjusted based on local medical resource availability.
Our new model is available for public sharing on the
link (https://xqccccc.shinyapps.io/DynNomapp/), and it
can interactively calculate the speciÔ¨Åc death probability
and conÔ¨Ådence interval of patients. Figure 6 shows its
interactive windows.
In our dataset, the performance of our model with
all eight factors showed ([ACC D 94.8%, AUC D
99.0%, sensitivity D 1, and speciÔ¨Åcity D 0.939]; the
performance was adjusted to [ACC D 88.7%, AUC D
94.1%, sensitivity D 0.583, and speciÔ¨Åcity D 0.986])
when using the mentioned three common variables
(age[6, 10, 26], temperature[27‚Äì29], and RR[19]). As shown

In this scorecard model, the roles of eight variables can
be interpreted clinically and independently. SpeciÔ¨Åcally,
neutrophils are the main members of the leukocyte
family. The increase in neutrophil levels introduces
excessive reactive oxygen species and causes tissue
damage, especially in elderly or frail people and
indicates various types of bacterial infection[30, 31].
Existing studies[32, 33] explained the strong causation
correlation between neutrophil growth and the increased
death risk. The increased levels of hsTnl and IL-10 and
decreased levels of lymphocytes are explicit risk factors
for COVID-19 patient death[34‚Äì36]. These abnormalities
indicate that COVID-19 infection may be associated
with cellular immune deÔ¨Åciency, myocardial injury, and
cytokine storm, which also reveals that systemic immune
response is a critical factor related to the Ô¨Ånal outcomes
of COVID-19 subjects. As for other variables, such as

example, at the early stage of a disease such as the
COVID-19 outbreak. The Ô¨Årst issue was the removal of
redundant noises from high-dimensional data variables
using the entropy information theory. These variables
were selected and processed layer by layer, to Ô¨Ånd
key factors of COVID-19 death risk. Finally, the
Ô¨Åndings on these key factors were mapped to a simple
scorecard, which is a digital tool for translating data
into clinical information to allow doctors to control
the death risks during ICU admission of COVID-19
patients. In applications, the thresholds of the scorecard
can be adjusted based on the actual availability of
local medical resources. To illustrate how the model
works in different datasets, we created and applied a
partial kernel performance test method. In this study,
training data were all from Chinese patients, and the
results‚Äô effectiveness may have some limitations when
extended to other populations, including inÔ¨Çuence from
differences in genes, environment, medical treatment
methods, etc. This model should be further optimized
for cases in different countries/regions. Thus, our model
provides a handy digital assistant to physicians for
handling new or unknown diseases for death risk control
and medical resource management.
age[6, 10, 26], temperature[27‚Äì29], and RR[19], their increase
either means a high risk of hospitalization mortality
for COVID-19 patients. These three factors are also
common risk factors for other types of pneumonia[37‚Äì39].
Disease cluster is a special and extensively studied fact,
and in such a case, a patient can infect those who
are close to him or her in a relatively short period.
These patients are likely to recover rapidly as they are
determined by the scoreboard as positive for proper
treatment as early as possible.
In this retrospective study, our main objective was
to Ô¨Ånd an effective and efÔ¨Åcient way that can provide
a scientiÔ¨Åc tool to process complex data and help
in processing unknown or unclear data knowledge to

This study solved a critical problem of how to allow a
computing algorithm to produce clinical explanation
results, regardless of its black-box mechanism. To
address this problem, we developed a visual scientiÔ¨Åc
tool for clinical decision support during ICU admission
of COVID-19 patients by reÔ¨Åning some critical
factors using an entropy-based method. Compared with
traditional machine learning models, our scorecard
model is a scientiÔ¨Åc clinical interpretation tool to be used
by doctors for medical resource planning, especially in
massive epidemics like the COVID-19 situation during
the past three years globally. In this retrospective study,
we assessed 322 adults (age: [median: 64; IQR: 54‚Äì75],
males: 178 [55.28%], and death: 72 [22.36%]) who
are the laboratory-conÔ¨Årmed COVID-19 ICU patients
from the national medical team in Wuhan.
These
patients were randomly grouped into training (70%)
and validation (30%) cohorts. In the training cohort,
all kinds of continuous-type data were Ô¨Årst discretized
using an entropy-based method (tree-like segment) to
obtain the cutoff endpoints of the information margin,
and they were helpful in relating clinical explanation to
complex data. Combining other discrete data, a logistic
regression was adopted to conÔ¨Ågure a scorecard of death
risk factors in visualization and compare it with machine
learning algorithms. Logistic regression was utilized
to identify the risk factors of patients with COVID-19,
and a scorecard with the selected eight variables was
built for clinical use. Calibration curves, PSI, and DCA
were used to evaluate the performance of the scorecard
in validation cohorts. In terms of survival probability
analyses, this scorecard model can interpret clinical
meanings from complex data with the desired computing
performance (ACC D 94.8%; AUC D 99.0%, compared
with several other typical machine learning methods,
such as XGBoost (ACC D 85.6%; AUC D 96.0%), RF
(ACC D 87.6%; AUC D 98.0%) and a voting classiÔ¨Åer
(XGBoost C RF) (ACC D 87.6%; AUC D 98.0%)).
Notably, some limitations were noted in this study, such
as how to set up a clinical cohort to validate this model in
real-life, how to Ô¨Ånd clinical explanations from missing
or unconsidered data, and how to design an online
computing model to help in the treatment of any new
diseases, etc. These topics are open for the next study.
