 This paper presents a case study of Baheya Foundation for Early Detection and Treatment of Breast Cancer, focusing on the impact of implementing a digital health system on the quality of healthcare services and the hospital's distinction. The author compared the hospital management system and patient services before and after implementing the digital health system. Results indicated that the implementation significantly improved the quality of healthcare services, making Baheya Hospital one of the top-ranked healthcare providers in Egypt, due to its early adoption of modern digital health systems in hospital management, patient data, and artificial intelligence technology in treatment devices. The study recommends using Baheya Hospital as a model for other healthcare institutions in Egypt to achieve excellence in healthcare services.
