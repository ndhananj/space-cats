 This paper reviews existing research on machine learning-based energy management systems for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). The review focuses on reinforcement learning approaches used to optimize FCEV operation and reduce costs. The author concludes that while progress has been made in this field, there are still opportunities for further research and development, particularly in improving the efficiency of energy management systems through advanced machine learning techniques. This research is important for advancing FCEV technology, which can provide clean, sustainable, and high-energy density transportation solutions, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.
