 This paper proposes a hybrid model to predict air pollution levels from multiple monitoring stations, aiming to improve the accuracy and efficiency of existing models. The model integrates an extended ARIMA, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), and truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). First, the extended ARIMA is used to predict matrix series of multiple air quality indicators from several adjacent monitoring stations. Then, EMD decomposes the time-series data into multiple smooth sub-series. Lastly, SVD compresses and denoises the expanded matrix. The experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate that this hybrid model surpasses traditional forecasting methods in terms of accuracy and time cost for air quality prediction.
