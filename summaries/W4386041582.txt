 This paper presents an empirical study on malware evasion attacks against IoT and other devices, with a focus on obfuscation and adversarial attacks. The researchers applied 10 obfuscation attacks and 9 adversarial attacks to 2870 malware examples, finding that commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) malware detectors are vulnerable to evasion attacks, with adversarial attacks being slightly more effective than obfuscated malware examples. Code similarity detection approaches can be affected by obfuscated examples but are barely affected by adversarial attacks. The study also found that these attacks can preserve the functionality of original malware examples. The key contributions of this paper include a systematic analysis of evasion attacks and an empirical evaluation of their impact on security, particularly in the context of IoT devices and AI-driven edge computing.
